You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time &#92;&#92;u2013 but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn total that amounted to &#36;3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Church Congregation Brings Gift to Waitresses Working on Christmas Eve, Has Them Crying (video)&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Ruth Harris&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:1,&#92;&quot;domain&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;beforeitsnews.com&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;fake&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;http://beforeitsnews.com/awakening-start-here/2018/01/awakening-of-12-strands-of-dna-reconnecting-with-you-movie-10623.html&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;AWAKENING OF 12 STRANDS of DNA &#92;&#92;u2013 &#92;&#92;u201cReconnecting with You&#92;&#92;u201d Movie&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n% of readers think this story is Fact.

a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. This shark has a unique feature. And it&#92;&#92;u2019s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. This shark&#92;&#92;u2019s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. If you&#92;&#92;u2019ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie &#92;&#92;u201cAlien,&#92;&#92;u201d this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. This shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. It&#92;&#92;u2019s a deadly predator of the deep sea.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. In the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBut during a routine survey in the Donghe Township in Taiwan, the country&#92;&#92;u2019s Fisheries Research Institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe team was notably horrified and described &#92;&#92;u201cthe most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. This is also the origin of viper shark name.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat&#92;&#92;u2019s right. This beast is called the viper shark. And as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAlthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. But researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. Could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. Four were already dead. But a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. But it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. It perished just a day later.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhile viper sharks look like the Alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. Their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. One of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. These creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. And when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of Shikoku Island in Japan in 1986. Bottom-trawler vessel Seiryo-Maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it&#92;&#92;u2019s scientific name honors the Seiryo-Maru captain, Hiromichi Kabeya.

The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president&#92;&#92;u2019s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThis poll was able to capture Americans&#92;&#92;u2019 opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a &#92;&#92;u201cvery stable genius&#92;&#92;u201d before they were interviewed. He said:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u2018Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.&#92;&#92;u2019&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThen, there was the question of Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s Genius Poll Is Complete &amp; The Results Have Americans Bursting With Laughter&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Gloria Christie&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:5,&#92;&quot;domain&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;blackagendareport.com&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;unreliable&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;https://blackagendareport.com/articlelist/Media%20and%20Culture&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;u201cRepublicans and Democrats alike are willing to turn over government coffers to Bezos and his ilk and the rights of the people be damned.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Black Agenda Report&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Margaret Kimberley, Bar Editor, Senior Columnist, Glen Ford, Bar Executive Editor, Nellie Bailey, Kyle Fraser, Black Agenda Radio Producer, Nellie Bailiey&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:6,&#92;&quot;domain&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;awarenessact.com&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;conspiracy&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;http://awarenessact.com/tag/waking-up-in-the-morgue/&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Could you imagine waking up in the morgue?

HOWEVER THE MOVEMENT ACROSS TO LONDON IS NOT AS SEVERE AS IN GOLD AS THERE SEEMS TO BE MAJOR PLAYERS WILLING TO TAKE ON THE BANKS AT THE COMEX. STILL, WITH THE TRANSFER OF 2598 CONTRACTS, WHAT THE CME IS STATING IS THAT THERE IS NO SILVER (OR GOLD) TO BE DELIVERED UPON AT THE COMEX AS THEY MUST EXPORT THEIR OBLIGATION TO LONDON. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE CAN BE A DELAY OF 24 HRS IN THE ISSUING OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nACCUMULATION FOR EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S/SILVER/ STARTING FROM FIRST DAY NOTICE/FOR MONTH OF JANUARY:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n37,797 CONTRACTS (FOR 17 TRADING DAYS TOTAL 37,797 CONTRACTS OR 188.98 MILLION OZ: AVERAGE PER DAY: 2223 CONTRACTS OR 11.116 MILLION OZ/DAY)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AS TO THE HUGE SUPPLY THIS MONTH IN SILVER: SO FAR THIS MONTH: 188.98 MILLION PAPER OZ HAVE MORPHED OVER TO LONDON. THIS REPRESENTS AROUND 26.99% OF ANNUAL GLOBAL PRODUCTION&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRESULT: A TINY SIZED LOSS IN OI COMEX DESPITE THE 6 CENT LOSS IN SILVER PRICE WHICH USUALLY INDICATES ANOTHER FAILED BANKER SHORT-COVERING. WE ALSO HAD A HUGE SIZED EFP ISSUANCE OF 2598 CONTRACTS WHICH EXITED OUT OF THE SILVER COMEX AND TRANSFERRED THEIR OI TO LONDON AS FORWARDS. SPECULATORS CONTINUED THEIR INTEREST IN ATTACKING THE SILVER COMEX FOR PHYSICAL SILVER . FROM THE CME DATA 2598 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S WERE ISSUED FOR TODAY FOR A DELIVERABLE FORWARD CONTRACT OVER IN LONDON WITH A FIAT BONUS. WE REALLY GAINED 2522 OI CONTRACTS i.e. 2598 open interest contracts headed for London (EFP&#92;&#92;u2019s) TOGETHER WITH A DECREASE OF 76 OI COMEX CONTRACTS. AND ALL OF THIS HAPPENED WITH THE FALL IN PRICE OF SILVER OF 6 CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF &#36;16.92 WITH RESPECT TO YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING. YET WE STILL HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF SILVER STANDING AT THE COMEX.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn ounces AT THE COMEX, the OI is still represented by just UNDER 1 BILLION oz i.e. 0.999 BILLION TO BE EXACT or 141% of annual global silver production (ex Russia &amp; ex China).&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFOR THE NEW FRONT JANUARY MONTH/ THEY FILED: 10 NOTICE(S) FOR 50,000 OZ OF SILVER&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn gold, the open interest SURPRISINGLY ROSE BY A CONSIDERABLE 9126 CONTRACTS UP TO582,421 WITH THE GOOD SIZED RISE IN PRICE OF GOLD WITH YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING (&#36;5.55). IN ANOTHER HUGE DEVELOPMENT, WE RECEIVED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GOLD EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S ISSUED FOR WEDNESDAY AND IT TOTALED A HUMONGOUS SIZED 12,223 CONTRACTS OF WHICH FEBRUARY SAW 11,023 CONTRACTS ISSUED AND APRIL SAW THE ISSUANCE OF 1200 CONTRACTS. The new OI for the gold complex rests at 583,590. ALSO REMEMBER THAT THERE CAN BE A DELAY IN THE ISSUANCE OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S. THE BANKERS REMOVE LONG POSITIONS OF COMEX GOLD IMMEDIATELY. THEN THEY ORCHESTRATE THEIR PRIVATE EFP DEAL WITH THE LONGS AND THAT COULD TAKE AN ADDITIONAL 48 HRS SO WE GENERALLY DO NOT GET A MATCH WITH RESPECT TO DEPARTING COMEX LONGS AND NEW EFP LONG TRANSFERS. DEMAND FOR GOLD INTENSIFIES GREATLY AS WE CONTINUE TO WITNESS A HUGE NUMBER OF EFP TRANSFERS TOGETHER WITH THE MASSIVE INCREASE IN GOLD COMEX OI TOGETHER WITH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOLD OUNCES STANDING FOR JANUARY COMEX. EVEN THOUGH THE BANKERS ISSUED THESE MONSTROUS EFPS, THE OBLIGATION STILL RESTS WITH THE BANKERS TO SUPPLY METAL BUT IT TRANSFERS THE RISK TO A LONDON BANKER OBLIGATION AND NOT A NEW YORK COMEX OBLIGATION. LONGS RECEIVE A FIAT BONUS TOGETHER WITH A LONG LONDON FORWARD. THUS, BY THESE ACTIONS, THE BANKERS AT THE COMEX HAVE JUST STATED THAT THEY HAVE NO APPRECIABLE METAL!! THIS IS A MASSIVE FRAUD: THEY CANNOT SUPPLY ANY METAL TO OUR COMEX LONGS BUT THEY ARE QUITE WILLING TO SUPPLY MASSIVE NON BACKED GOLD (AND SILVER) PAPER KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE NO METAL TO SATISFY OUR LONGS. LONDON IS NOW SEVERELY BACKWARD IN BOTH GOLD AND SILVER (BIG RISE IN BOTH GOFO AND SIFO) AND WE ARE WITNESSING DELAYS IN ACTUAL DELIVERIES. IN ESSENCE TODAY WE HAVE A HUGE GAIN OF 21,349 CONTRACTS: 9126 OI CONTRACTS INCREASED AT THE COMEX AND A GOOD SIZED 12,223 OI CONTRACTS WHICH NAVIGATED OVER TO LONDON. EXPECT HUGE NUMBERS OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S TO BE ISSUED AS WE APPROACH FIRST DAY NOTICE IN THE GOLD FEB COMEX CONTRACT, WEDNESDAY JAN 31.2018&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nYESTERDAY, WE HAD 11,759 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S ISSUED.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nACCUMULATION OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S/ GOLD(EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL) FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY STARTING WITH FIRST DAY NOTICE: 164,474 CONTRACTS OR 16.474 MILLION OZ OR 512.41 TONNES(17 TRADING DAYS AND THUS AVERAGING: 9674 EFP CONTRACTS PER TRADING DAY OR 967,400 OZ/DAY)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AS TO THE HUGE SIZE OF THESE EFP TRANSFERS : SO FAR THIS MONTH IN 17 TRADING DAYS: IN TONNES: 513 TONNES&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTOTAL ANNUAL GOLD PRODUCTION, 2017, THROUGHOUT THE WORLD EX CHINA EX RUSSIA: 2200 TONNES&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTHUS EFP TRANSFERS REPRESENTS 474/2200 TONNES = 23.31% OF GLOBAL ANNUAL PRODUCTION SO FAR IN JANUARY ALONE.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nResult: A SHOCKINGLY STRONG SIZED INCREASE IN OI AT THE COMEX WITH THE FAIR SIZED RISE IN PRICE IN GOLD TRADING ON YESTERDAY (&#36;5.55). WE HAD ANOTHER GIGANTIC SIZED NUMBER OF COMEX LONG TRANSFERRING TO LONDON THROUGH THE EFP ROUTE: 12,223. THERE OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH PHYSICAL GOLD AT THE COMEX AND YET WE ALSO OBSERVED A HUGE DELIVERY MONTH FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. I GUESS IT EXPLAINS THE HUGE ISSUANCE OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S&#92;&#92;u2026THERE IS HARDLY ANY GOLD PRESENT AT THE GOLD COMEX FOR DELIVERY PURPOSES. IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE 12,223 EFP CONTRACTS ISSUED, WE HAD A NET GAIN IN OPEN INTEREST OF 21,349 contracts ON THE TWO EXCHANGES:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n12,223 CONTRACTS MOVE TO LONDON AND 9,126 CONTRACTS INCREASED AT THE COMEX.

Today, we had the open interest in silver FELL BY A TINY 76 contracts from 200,061 DOWN TO 199,985 (AND now A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE NEW COMEX RECORD SET ON FRIDAY/APRIL 21/2017 AT 234,787) WITH THE FALL IN PRICE OF SILVER TO THE TUNE OF 5 CENTS WITH RESPECT TO YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING. OUR BANKERS USED THEIR EMERGENCY PROCEDURE TO ISSUE ANOTHER GOOD 2598 PRIVATE EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S FOR MARCH (WE DO NOT GET A LOOK AT THESE CONTRACTS AS IT IS PRIVATE BUT THE CFTC DOES AUDIT THEM) AND 0 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S FOR ALL OTHER MONTHS . EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S GIVE OUR COMEX LONGS A FIAT BONUS PLUS A DELIVERABLE PRODUCT OVER IN LONDON. WE HAD ZERO COMEX SILVER COMEX LIQUIDATION. IF WE TAKE THE OI LOSS AT THE COMEX OF 76 CONTRACTSTO THE 2598 OI TRANSFERRED TO LONDON THROUGH EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S WE OBTAIN A BIG GAIN OF 2522 OPEN INTEREST CONTRACTS. WE STILL HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF SILVER OUNCES THAT ARE STANDING FOR METAL IN JANUARY (SEE BELOW). THE NET GAIN TODAY IN OZ ON THE TWO EXCHANGES: 12.61 MILLION OZ!!!&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRESULT: A SMALL SIZED DECREASE IN SILVER OI AT THE COMEX DESPITE THE TINY FALL OF 6 CENTS IN PRICE (WITH RESPECT TO YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING). BUT WE ALSO HAD ANOTHER STRONG 2598 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S ISSUED TRANSFERRING COMEX LONGS OVER TO LONDON. TOGETHER WITH THE GOOD SIZED AMOUNT OF SILVER OUNCES STANDING FOR JANUARY, DEMAND FOR PHYSICAL SILVER INTENSIFIES AS WE WITNESS MAJOR BANK SHORT COVERING ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASES IN GOFO AND SIFO RATES INDICATING SCARCITY.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n(report Harvey)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n2.a) The Shanghai and London gold fix report&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n(Harvey)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n2 b) Gold/silver trading overnight Europe, Goldcore&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n(Mark O&#92;&#92;u2019Byrne/zerohedge&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nand in NY: Bloomberg&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n3.

There&#92;&#92;u2019s just no getting around it that some words are more painful than cuss words, particularly when they heap praise on abortion advocates. &#92;&#92;u201cMembers of President Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s evangelical advisory council decided to jump ship for the day and publicly sided with Nancy Pelosi on DACA. (RedState, Jan. 18, 2018)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cYou have always taken the lead. Your commitment to the immigrant community to the &#92;&#92;u2018Dreamers&#92;&#92;u2019 is second to none. So America is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter,&#92;&#92;u201d the Rev.Samuel Rodriguez, who spoke at Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s inauguration last year, told Pelosi at a press conference on Thursday.&#92;&#92;u201d Prophetic? Really?&#92;&#92;u201d Pelosi, of course, is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected, coming second only to former President Barack Obama, champion of partial birth abortion. How sincere was Rev. Rodriguez when he raised the name of President Donald Trump in prayer at his inauguration? Discomfited by the president&#92;&#92;u2019s use of an expression he has denied using, Rev. Rodriguez, a member of the &#92;&#92;u201cunofficial&#92;&#92;u201d evangelical advisory board and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference noted that &#92;&#92;u201cevery single person is created in the image of God&#92;&#92;u201d and spoke of welcoming people equally from Nigeria and Norway, albeit after &#92;&#92;u201ca rigorous vetting process.&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u201cLater in the day, he said more: &#92;&#92;u201cIn addition, and with great due deference, I believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful. Why? Because when God looks at these nations, He sees His children.&#92;&#92;u201d (Yahoo, Jan. 15, 2018)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt should go without saying that our Creator sees among &#92;&#92;u201cHis children, millions of babies killed in their mother&#92;&#92;u2019s wombs. Sadly, the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president&#92;&#92;u2019s alleged use of the &#92;&#92;u2018s&#92;&#92;u2019 word as more preach-worthy than the open advocation of abortion. Isn&#92;&#92;u2019t it more than a tad hypocritical, if not downright sanctimonious that the Vatican newspaper, L&#92;&#92;u2019Osservatore Romano would try a wash-his-mouth-with-soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of President Donald Trump? We all know by now that President Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s alleged use of the &#92;&#92;u2018s&#92;&#92;u2019 word was tattle-taled to the Internet world by Catholic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been &#92;&#92;u201crepeatedly&#92;&#92;u201d used at a White House meeting on immigration. Tattletale Dicky Durbin&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nContinued below... The newspaper, L&#92;&#92;u2019Osservatore Romano&#92;&#92;u2014the Vatican&#92;&#92;u2019s flagship&#92;&#92;u2014gave Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s comments about the immigration debate in the United States, front page attention, noting the comments had immediately sparked &#92;&#92;u201ccontroversy and indignation&#92;&#92;u201d. Never mind that Trump denies using the term. Mercifully, the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the Democrats into a full-on faux rage. No, none of that over here. But it&#92;&#92;u2019s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up. Some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as&#92;&#92;u2014if not more&#92;&#92;u2014offensive to the Faithful. Some some pro-life Catholics must have thought of the &#92;&#92;u2018s&#92;&#92;u2019 word when reading on Twitter that abortion advocate Lilianne Ploumen, former Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation in the Netherlands, was recently honored by Pope Francis with the title of &#92;&#92;u2018Commander in the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great&#92;&#92;u2019. This was one Tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true: &#92;&#92;u201cThe Lepanto Institute was able to confirm from a December 22, 2017 Dutch radio broadcast that Ploumen indeed received the honor. In a brief video clip promoting the broadcast, Ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the Pope. (Lepanto Institute, Jan.12, 2018)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cTo say that Lilianne Ploumen is &#92;&#92;u201cpro-abortion&#92;&#92;u201d is an extreme understatement and doesn&#92;&#92;u2019t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism. &#92;&#92;u201cIn January of last year, after US President Donald Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, Ploumen launched a new NGO called She Decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the US government. The Mexico City Policy automatically denies US funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion. &#92;&#92;u201cReferring to the Mexico City Policy as a &#92;&#92;u201cGlobal Gag Rule,&#92;&#92;u201d Ploumen stated that the intention of She Decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA), the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International. She said, &#92;&#92;u201cThese are successful and effective programs: direct support, distributing condoms, making sure women are accompanied at the birth, and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice.&#92;&#92;u201d The LePanto Institute continues their Ploumen profile: &#92;&#92;u201cBut Ploumen&#92;&#92;u2019s anti-Catholic activity isn&#92;&#92;u2019t restricted to abortion. In September of 2017, Ploumen participated in the United Nations LGBTI Core Group. As the first speaker at the event, Ploumen noted that &#92;&#92;u201cLGBTI rights are human rights.&#92;&#92;u201d In her opening remarks, she said, &#92;&#92;u201cWe cannot be complacent. [Today] in more than 70 countries homosexuality is still criminalized&#92;&#92;u2026stigma against LGBT people continue all over the world.&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u201cIn 2014, Ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of Uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same-sex &#92;&#92;u201cmarriage.&#92;&#92;u201d In February of 2010, Ploumen called on LGBT activists to descend upon and disrupt Mass at St. John the Baptist Cathedral, wearing pink triangles with the words &#92;&#92;u201cJesus excludes no one.&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u201cThe reason? She and other pro-LGBT activists were protesting the Church&#92;&#92;u2019s moral teaching regarding homosexuality.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nContinued below... We already know how Pope Francis profiles President Donald Trump: &#92;&#92;u201cIn 2016, in response to a question about then-candidate Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, Francis said a man with such views was &#92;&#92;u201cnot Christian&#92;&#92;u201d. (Reuters, Jan. 12, 2018) &#92;&#92;u201cTrump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family, shot back saying it was &#92;&#92;u201cdisgraceful&#92;&#92;u201d for the pope to question his faith.&#92;&#92;u201d Actions speak so much louder than cuss words. Thousands will be taking part in the 2018 March for Life today. Neither Rev. Rodriguez nor Pope Francis will be there, but President Trump will be, addressing the crowd by satellite.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nCopyright &#92;&#92;u00a9 Canada Free Press&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRSS Feed for Judi McLeod&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nJudi McLeod is an award-winning journalist with 30 years&#92;&#92;u2019 experience in the print media.

A recent report led by theand the Center for Public Integrity, has revealed that the manufacturers of opioid drugs, such as OxyContin, Vicodin and fentanyl, spent a whopping &#36;880 million on campaign contributions and lobbying efforts. This huge amount of money was spent pushing against state efforts to restrict the amount of prescription opioid drugs floating around.For the unaware, the United States is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic &#92;&#92;u2013 one that has been particularly profitable for Big Pharma. OxyContin has been one of the most prolific drugs in the prescription opioid craze, and one of the most addictive.writes that a recent expose by theuncovered the fact that Purdue Pharma knowingly lied about their product. Despite being marketed as a 12-hour pill, the&#x27; handiwork revealed that Purdue &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;knew the claim was a lie, as did its sales reps, patients, medical professional and even regulatory authorities. At best, Oxy only provided eight hours of pain relief ...&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;This means that patients were exposed to withdrawal symptoms, received inadequate care, and were often pushed up to a higher dose of OxyContin &#92;&#92;u2013 which puts patients at increased risk of death. However, higher dosages make more money than more frequent doses, so this was a very clever, and malevolent , marketing choice by Purdue.You can see where this is the kind of company that caresabout public well-being, and quite a lot about profits. It is not surprising that Purdue Pharma, and others like them, have spent nearly a billion dollars trying to protect their hold on the American people. Between 2006 and 2015, Big Pharma spent nearly 200 times more fighting opioid restrictions than opioid restriction advocates spent in the same time period. Sadly, it is not just Big Pharma pushing their agenda. Even organizations that many people consider to be &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;respectable,&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; have dipped their toes in the pond. The American Cancer Society, for example, has reportedly teamed up with the pharmaceutical industry.Opioids are very similar to heroin, only they can be prescribed to patients as pain relievers. Due to their highly addictive nature, it is no surprise that the industry desperately wants to protect their ability to be prescribed to anyone for just about anything; opioids are a cash cow.Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a tremendous supporter of prescription opioid reform, told the: &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;They are reaping enormous profits from aggressive prescribing.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; And while they benefit, millions suffer.Over 2 million Americans reportedly suffer with an addiction to opioid drugs. Just shy of a half-million people suffer with heroin addiction, as well. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that roughly 80 percent of all heroin users report that their addiction began with misusing opioid drugs . Being that prescription opioids are rather expensive, it is no surprise that people eventually move on to less expensive options. This figure shows that it is not just people currently using prescription opioids that are being harmed by these drugs, but many others as well. One could even postulate that a significant portion of heroin overdoses could be traced back to opioids, in addition to the thousands of deaths caused by opioids directly. Some estimates indicate that opioids are related to up to 60 deaths each day Spending &#36;880 million on protecting their profits instead of supporting legislation that would help to end the opioid epidemic ensured that their priorities would be easily understood. Despite the claims of Big Pharma companies like Purdue that they actually care about addiction and the people affected by it, it has becomeclear that thethey care about is the fact that it makes them money.&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;&#x27;Stop Christie&#x27; PAC quits, says candidate did its job for them&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;A Bad Witch&#x27;S Blog&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;Big Government&#x27;, &#x27;mark levin&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;&#x27;Enough meddling ...

All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;u2014Hermann Goering, German military commander and Hitler&#92;&#92;u2019s designated successor&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nHere are some of the lessons we in the United States learned too late about allowing our freedoms to be eviscerated in exchange for the phantom promise of security.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhat remains to be seen is whether France, standing where the United States did 14 years ago, will follow in America&#92;&#92;u2019s footsteps as she grapples with the best way to shore up her defenses, where to draw the delicate line in balancing security with liberty, and what it means to secure justice for those whose lives were taken.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOnce again, there is that same sense of shock. The same shocking images of carnage and grief dominating the news. The same disbelief that anyone could be so hateful, so monstrous, so evil as to do this to another human being. The same outpourings of support and unity from around the world. The same shared fear that this could easily have happened to us or our loved ones.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBeware of mammoth legislation that expands the government&#92;&#92;u2019s powers at the citizenry&#92;&#92;u2019s expense. Rushed through Congress a mere 45 days after the 9/11 attacks, the USA Patriot Act drove a stake through the heart of the Bill of Rights, undermined civil liberties, expanded the government&#92;&#92;u2019s powers and opened the door to far-reaching surveillance by the government on American citizens.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nPre-emptive strikes will only lead to further blowback. Not content to wage war against Afghanistan, which served as the base for Osama bin Laden, the U.S. embarked on a pre-emptive war against Iraq in order to &#92;&#92;u201cstop any adversary challenging America&#92;&#92;u2019s military superiority and adopt a strike-first policy against terrorist threats &#92;&#92;u2018before they&#x27;re fully formed.&#92;&#92;u2019&#92;&#92;u201d We are still suffering the consequences of this failed policy, which has resulted in lives lost, taxpayer dollars wasted, the fomenting of hatred against the U.S. and the further radicalization of terrorist cells.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWar is costly. There are many reasons to go to war, but those who have advocated that the U.S. remain at war, year after year, are the very entities that have profited most from these endless military occupations and exercises. Thus far, the U.S. taxpayer has been made to shell out more than &#36;1.6 trillion on &#92;&#92;u201cmilitary operations, the training of security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, weapons maintenance, base support, reconstruction, embassy maintenance, foreign aid, and veterans&#92;&#92;u2019 medical care, as well as war-related intelligence operations not tracked by the Pentagon&#92;&#92;u201d since 2001. Other estimates that account for war-related spending, veterans&#92;&#92;u2019 benefits and various promissory notes place that figure closer to &#36;4.4 trillion. That also does not include the more than 210,000 civilians killed so far, or the 7.6 million refugees displaced from their homes as a result of the endless drone strikes and violence.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAdvocating torture makes you no better than terrorists. The horrors that took place at Abu Ghraib, the American-run prison in Iraq, continue to shock those with any decency. Photographs leaked to the media depicted &#92;&#92;u201cUS military personnel humiliating, hurting and abusing Iraqi prisoners in a myriad of perverse ways. While American servicemen and women smiled and gave thumbs up, naked men were threatened by dogs, or were hooded, forced into sexual positions, placed standing with wires attached to their bodies, or left bleeding on prison floors.&#92;&#92;u201d Adding to the descent into moral depravity, the United States government legalized the use of torture, including waterboarding, in violation of international law and continues to sanction human rights violations in the pursuit of national security. The ramifications have been far-reaching, with local police now employing similar torture tactics at secret locations such as Homan Square in Chicago.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAllowing the government to spy on the citizenry will not reduce acts of terrorism, but it will result in a watched, submissive, surveillance society. A byproduct of this post 9/11-age in which we live, whether you&#92;&#92;u2019re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. This doesn&#92;&#92;u2019t even begin to touch on the corporate trackers such as Google that monitor your purchases, web browsing, Facebook posts and other activities taking place in the cyber sphere. We are all becoming data collected in government files. The chilling effect of this endless surveillance is a more anxious and submissive citizenry.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nDon&#92;&#92;u2019t become so distracted by the news cycle that you lose sight of what the government is doing. The average American has a hard time keeping up with and remembering all of the &#92;&#92;u201cevents,&#92;&#92;u201d manufactured or otherwise, which occur like clockwork and keep us distracted, deluded, amused, and insulated from the reality of the American police state. Whether these events are critical or unimportant, when we&#92;&#92;u2019re being bombarded with wall-to-wall news coverage and news cycles that change every few days, it&#92;&#92;u2019s difficult to stay focused on one thing&#92;&#92;u2014namely, holding the government accountable to abiding by the rule of law&#92;&#92;u2014and the powers-that-be understand this. In this way, regularly scheduled trivia and/or distractions that keep the citizenry tuned into the various breaking news headlines and entertainment spectacles also keep them tuned out to the government&#92;&#92;u2019s steady encroachments on their freedoms.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIf you stop holding the government accountable to the rule of law, the only laws it abides by will be the ones used to clamp down on the citizenry. Having failed to hold government officials accountable to abiding by the rule of law, the American people have found themselves saddled with a government that skirts, flouts and violates the Constitution with little consequence. Overcriminalization, asset forfeiture schemes, police brutality, profit-driven prisons, warrantless surveillance, SWAT team raids, indefinite detentions, covert agencies, and secret courts are just a few of the egregious practices carried out by a government that operates beyond the reach of the law.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nDo not turn your country into a battlefield, your citizens into enemy combatants, and your law enforcement officers into extensions of the military. A standing army&#92;&#92;u2014something that propelled the early colonists into revolution&#92;&#92;u2014strips the citizenry of any vestige of freedom. How can there be any semblance of freedom when there are tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, Blackhawk helicopters and armed drones patrolling overhead? It was for this reason that those who established America vested control of the military in a civilian government, with a civilian commander-in-chief. They did not want a military government, ruled by force. Rather, they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law: the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately, we in America now find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies that look and act like the military and have just as little regard for the Fourth Amendment, laws such as the NDAA that allow the military to arrest and indefinitely detain American citizens, and military drills that acclimate the American people to the sight of armored tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, and combat aircraft patrolling overhead.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAs long as you remain fearful and distrustful of each other, you will be incapable of standing united against any threats posed by a power-hungry government. Early on, U.S. officials solved the problem of how to implement their authoritarian policies without incurring a citizen uprising: fear. The powers-that-be want us to feel threatened by forces beyond our control (terrorists, shooters, bombers). They want us afraid and dependent on the government and its militarized armies for our safety and well-being. Most of all, they want us distrustful of each other, divided by our prejudices, and at each other&#92;&#92;u2019s throats.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIf you trade your freedom for security, the terrorists win. We&#92;&#92;u2019ve walked a strange and harrowing road since September 11, 2001, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties. We have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade a freedom-loving people to march in lockstep with a police state. And in so doing, we have proven Osama Bin Laden right. He warned that &#92;&#92;u201cfreedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in &#92;&#92;u2014 and the West in general &#92;&#92;u2014 into an unbearable hell and a choking life.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTo sum things up, the destruction that began with the 9/11 terror attacks has expanded into an all-out campaign of terror, trauma, acclimation and indoctrination aimed at getting Americans used to life in the American Police State. The bogeyman&#92;&#92;u2019s names and faces change over time, but the end result remains the same: our unquestioning acquiescence to anything the government wants to do in exchange for the phantom promise of safety and security has transitioned us to life in a society where government agents routinely practice violence on the citizens while, in conjunction with the Corporate State, spying on the most intimate details of our personal lives.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe lesson learned, as I document in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, is simply this: once you start down the road towards a police state, it will be very difficult to turn back.&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;u201cDraining the Swamp&#92;&#92;u201d Doesn&#92;&#92;u2019t Matter as Long as Groupthink Persists&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;nan&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;nan&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;u201cWe are on the precipice of committing U.S. forces to another forever war,&#92;&#92;u201d Maryland Sen.

plan to continue deploying american military forces in syria goes beyond his authority under federal law according to a top senate democrat&#92;&#92;nwe are on the precipice of committing &lt;URL&gt; forces to another forever war maryland sen ben cardin the ranking member on the foreign relations committee said thursday&#92;&#92;nthat was a rebuke of secretary of state rex tillerson who outlined &lt;OTHER&gt; policy for syria following the destruction of the islamic state as a landholding terrorist organization tillerson explained that &lt;URL&gt; forces and diplomats must work to prevent the resurgence of isis and the domination of syria by iranian-backed terrorists but cardin maintained the new policy exceeds anything authorized by congress&#92;&#92;ni am extremely disappointed that the trump administration announced a significant change in &lt;URL&gt; policy &lt;OTHER&gt; the commitment of &lt;URL&gt; forces for an indefinite period of time in syria &lt;OTHER&gt; without first consulting congress cardin said the trump administration lacks the authority to keep &lt;URL&gt; military forces in syria after the defeat of isis&#92;&#92;ntrump like former president barack obama has traced the legal authority for counter-isis operations back to the legislation that authorized military action action against al qaeda in response to the sept &lt;DATE&gt; terrorist attacks isis formed out of the remnants of al &lt;OTHER&gt; affiliate in iraq tillerson tied the new syria policy to that legal basis by noting the potential for isis to rehabilitate itself in the absence of &lt;URL&gt; forces&#92;&#92;nisis presently has one foot in the grave and by maintaining an american military presence in syria until the full and complete defeat of isis is achieved it will soon have two he said&#92;&#92;nin &lt;OTHER&gt; telling such a complete victory &lt;OTHER&gt; over isis or iranian forces in the country &lt;OTHER&gt; depends on the success of a broader effort to bring peace and stability to syria&#92;&#92;nungoverned spaces especially in conflict zones are breeding grounds for isis and other terrorist organizations he said &lt;URL&gt; disengagement from syria would provide iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in syria as we have seen from &lt;OTHER&gt; proxy wars and public announcements iran seeks dominance in the middle east and the destruction of our ally israel as a destabilized nation and one bordering israel syria presents an opportunity that iran is all too eager to exploit&#92;&#92;nthe unveiling of the plan could renew congressional interest in crafting a new legislation defining the &lt;OTHER&gt; legal authority to conduct counter-terrorism operations for years lawmakers in both parties have struggled to agree on the details of a new authorization of the use of military force&#92;&#92;ncongress has been unable to bridge the gap between those who see a new aumf as primarily an opportunity to limit the president and those who believe constraining the commander in chief in wartime is unwise senate foreign relations chairman bob corker r-tenn said during a recent hearing&#92;&#92;n&lt;OTHER&gt; announcement is sure to spark a new round of debate on the policy though the state and defense departments must immediately consult with the members of the senate foreign relations committee which retains jurisdiction over the use of military force cardin said&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;ben cardin trumps new syria plan is illegal&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;joel gehrke&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;rex tillerson isis senate foreign relations ben cardin state department syria national security senate joel gehrke congress news politics&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;we are on the precipice of committing &lt;URL&gt;

donald j trump realdonaldtrump october &lt;DATE&gt;&#92;&#92;nhe is not wrong and the newsweek article acknowledges as much&#92;&#92;nit acknowledges that former president bill clinton received a generous &lt;DATE&gt; speaking fee in &lt;DATE&gt; from a kremlin-linked bank with ties to uranium one a canadian uranium company that had mines in the &lt;URL&gt; the newsweek article also acknowledges a separate new york times report that showed uranium ones chairman donated approximately &lt;URL&gt; million to the clinton foundation in four separate installments as his company was being acquired by a russian nuclear energy firm called rosatom&#92;&#92;ntheres more from the times report and none of it reflects well on the clintons&#92;&#92;nas the russians gradually assumed control of uranium one in three separate transactions from &lt;DATE&gt; to &lt;DATE&gt; canadian records show a flow of cash made its way to the clinton foundation uranium ones chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling &lt;URL&gt; million those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the clintons despite an agreement mrs clinton had struck with the obama white house to publicly identify all donors other people with ties to the company made donations as well&#92;&#92;nthe only thing the newsweek fact check disputes is whether the millions paid had anything to do with rosatoms successful efforts to secure approval from the state department to acquire uranium one the &lt;URL&gt; committee on foreign investment gave the go-ahead in october &lt;DATE&gt; handing the russian state-owned nuclear agency control of &lt;NUM&gt; percent of the uranium in america&#92;&#92;nits unclear whether the russian cash given to the clinton foundation had anything to do with bill clintons attempts in &lt;DATE&gt; to facilitate meetings with rosatom executives its also unclear whether the payments had anything to do with his decision to meet privately with russian president vladimir putin that same year&#92;&#92;nbut this is still a long way off from fact check no the clintons were not paid millions by russia&#92;&#92;naggravatingly enough the headline that appears on newsweeks website is evenhanded and reasonable it reads simply did russia send money to bill clintons foundation like trump says fact-checking the presidents claim its the social media version of this headline thats atrocious&#92;&#92;nthat said like the tweeted headline the body of the fact check also makes claims that it cant quite back including president is stretching the truth about the clinton foundation and money it received&#92;&#92;nwell perhaps but the clinton foundation did take in millions from the russians thats what the president tweeted&#92;&#92;nheres how the newsweek fact check concludes yes the foundation received money and bill clinton was paid to give a speech but theres no evidence the clintons were paid by russians to push through the uranium deal&#92;&#92;nthis is correct and itd probably be devastating were it a thing the president actually said but he didnt quite say that&#92;&#92;nhe implied it sure but whats the use of fact checking things that havent been said&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;newsweek fact check denies russian payments to clintons even though payments happened&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;becket adams&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;fake news clinton foundation becket adams social media foreign policy nuclear weapons media donald trump twitter vladimir putin new york times state department russia canada bill clinton hillary clinton president barack obama white house opinion beltway confidential&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;whats the use of fact checking things that havent been said&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;american forces made one of their most effective hits against the islamic state on nov &lt;NUM&gt; when &lt;URL&gt; planes destroyed &lt;NUM&gt; tanker trucks used by the terrorist organization to transport the stolen oil that is its financial lifeblood&#92;&#92;namerican &lt;OTHER&gt; and &lt;OTHER&gt; warplanes targeted a group of about &lt;NUM&gt; trucks near abu kamal in syria given that the islamic state is thought to have just over &lt;DATE&gt; trucks in its entire fleet the group of &lt;NUM&gt; represented a huge target for &lt;URL&gt; planes&#92;&#92;nat a pentagon news conference last wednesday reporters wanted to know why american forces did not take out more than &lt;NUM&gt; trucks why not all &lt;NUM&gt; or something close to that a &lt;URL&gt; official said the american attackers simply ran out of ammunition&#92;&#92;nthere were &lt;NUM&gt; i think to begin with and then you hit &lt;NUM&gt; why didnt you go back a reporter asked operation inherent resolve spokesman col steve warren&#92;&#92;nfrankly the aircraft expended &lt;OTHER&gt; bombs and all of their ammunition warren answered so they &lt;OTHER&gt; they shot everything they had and then they had to go home&#92;&#92;njournalists had another question if oil is vitally important to the islamic state why didnt the &lt;URL&gt; hit the tanker trucks long ago given that the american anti-isis operation began in september &lt;DATE&gt;&#92;&#92;nif its so important to cut off the oil shipments the critical revenue source for isis why did it take so long to take out &lt;NUM&gt; oil tanker trucks a reporter asked&#92;&#92;nwarren explained that american officials were deeply worried about harming the truck drivers who were working for the islamic state but might not be isis themselves &lt;URL&gt; officials settled on a plan to drop leaflets on the trucks about &lt;NUM&gt; minutes before the raid warning the drivers that an attack was coming while &lt;URL&gt; pilots flew low passes over the area planning all that took time&#92;&#92;nthis is our first strike against tanker trucks warren said we have been striking oil infrastructure targets since the very beginning of this operation what we found out was that many of our strikes were only minimally effective we would strike pieces of the oil infrastructure that were easily repaired&#92;&#92;nwarren said &lt;URL&gt; officials conducted a study and decided to focus on the islamic states oil distribution network &lt;OTHER&gt; trucks but the problem was the drivers&#92;&#92;nwe have not struck these trucks before warren said we assessed that these trucks while although they are being used for operations that support isil the truck drivers themselves are probably not members of isil theyre probably just civilians so we had to figure out a way around that were not in this business to kill civilians were in this business to stop isil &lt;OTHER&gt; to defeat isil&#92;&#92;namerican officials decided on the leaflet-and-buzz plan we spent some time developing the leaflets the low pass warren said we did some some strafe runs as well &lt;OTHER&gt; to kind of shoo people away without harming them so we had to go through that whole process of one determining whether or not we felt it was in our best interest to strike these trucks and then once we determined that yes it is in our interest to strike these trucks how do we go about ensuring that were able to mitigate the potential of civilian casualties and these things take time&#92;&#92;nfinally when all the work had been done &lt;NUM&gt; islamic state trucks were found in one place it was an inviting target&#92;&#92;nthese trucks were queued up warren said they were sitting sort of on flat desert there wasnt really anything recognizable as a road around it was just out there on the desert floor in the vicinity of one of these oil fields one of these oil facilities that weve been striking so they were queued up there waiting to take on their illicit oil so these trucks were &lt;OTHER&gt; they were just sitting there not moving&#92;&#92;nit was an extraordinary opportunity to take out somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of the islamic states entire truck fleet and after destroying &lt;NUM&gt; the americans ran out of ammunition the remaining &lt;NUM&gt; trucks were not destroyed&#92;&#92;nbeyond the out-of-ammo problem reporters raised the issue of the &lt;URL&gt; forces extreme care in avoiding civilian casualties if american forces wont hit any target if there is any fear that any non-isis person might be harmed might that not prolong the time it takes to destroy the islamic state which is killing civilians right and left&#92;&#92;nis there a &lt;OTHER&gt; about not striking civilians and avoiding civilian casualties when over the past year the &lt;NUM&gt; million in oil revenue generated has been going to killing a large number of civilians a reporter asked is there any risk that avoiding civilian casualties is actually prolonging more civilian casualties&#92;&#92;nthat was a very thoughtful question warren conceded and an issue american war planners think about constantly but warren didnt have an answer its something that we wrestle with every day he said&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;byron york &lt;URL&gt;
