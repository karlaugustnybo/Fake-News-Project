You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time &#92;&#92;u2013 but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn total that amounted to &#36;3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Church Congregation Brings Gift to Waitresses Working on Christmas Eve, Has Them Crying (video)&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Ruth Harris&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:1,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;fake&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;http://beforeitsnews.com/awakening-start-here/2018/01/awakening-of-12-strands-of-dna-reconnecting-with-you-movie-10623.html&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;AWAKENING OF 12 STRANDS of DNA &#92;&#92;u2013 &#92;&#92;u201cReconnecting with You&#92;&#92;u201d Movie&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n% of readers think this story is Fact.

a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. This shark has a unique feature. And it&#92;&#92;u2019s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. This shark&#92;&#92;u2019s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. If you&#92;&#92;u2019ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie &#92;&#92;u201cAlien,&#92;&#92;u201d this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. This shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. It&#92;&#92;u2019s a deadly predator of the deep sea.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. In the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBut during a routine survey in the Donghe Township in Taiwan, the country&#92;&#92;u2019s Fisheries Research Institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe team was notably horrified and described &#92;&#92;u201cthe most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. This is also the origin of viper shark name.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat&#92;&#92;u2019s right. This beast is called the viper shark. And as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAlthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. But researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. Could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. Four were already dead. But a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. But it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. It perished just a day later.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhile viper sharks look like the Alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. Their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. One of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. These creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. And when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of Shikoku Island in Japan in 1986. Bottom-trawler vessel Seiryo-Maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it&#92;&#92;u2019s scientific name honors the Seiryo-Maru captain, Hiromichi Kabeya. The shark&#92;&#92;u2019s scientific name was Trigonognathus kabeyai.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAlthough not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. They have only been found in the deep parts of the Pacific Ocean.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nHow would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? Would you think you were having a nightmare?&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Elusive &#92;&#92;u2018Alien Of The Sea &#92;&#92;u2018 Caught By Scientist For One Of The First Times Ever (video)&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Alexander Smith&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:4,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;clickbait&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/21/trumps-genius-poll-is-complete-the-results-have-americans-bursting-with-laughter/&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president&#92;&#92;u2019s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThis poll was able to capture Americans&#92;&#92;u2019 opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a &#92;&#92;u201cvery stable genius&#92;&#92;u201d before they were interviewed. He said:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u2018Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.&#92;&#92;u2019&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThen, there was the question of Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s Genius Poll Is Complete &amp; The Results Have Americans Bursting With Laughter&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Gloria Christie&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:5,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;unreliable&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;https://blackagendareport.com/articlelist/Media%20and%20Culture&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;u201cRepublicans and Democrats alike are willing to turn over government coffers to Bezos and his ilk and the rights of the people be damned.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Black Agenda Report&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Margaret Kimberley, Bar Editor, Senior Columnist, Glen Ford, Bar Executive Editor, Nellie Bailey, Kyle Fraser, Black Agenda Radio Producer, Nellie Bailiey&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;&#92;&quot;:6,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;conspiracy&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;http://awarenessact.com/tag/waking-up-in-the-morgue/&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Could you imagine waking up in the morgue?

HOWEVER, WE WERE AGAIN NOTIFIED THAT WE HAD ANOTHER HUGE SIZED NUMBER OF COMEX LONGS TRANSFERRING THEIR CONTRACTS TO LONDON THROUGH THE EFP ROUTE: 2598 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S FOR MARCH AND ZERO FOR OTHER MONTHS AND THUS TOTAL ISSUANCE OF 2598 CONTRACTS. HOWEVER THE MOVEMENT ACROSS TO LONDON IS NOT AS SEVERE AS IN GOLD AS THERE SEEMS TO BE MAJOR PLAYERS WILLING TO TAKE ON THE BANKS AT THE COMEX. STILL, WITH THE TRANSFER OF 2598 CONTRACTS, WHAT THE CME IS STATING IS THAT THERE IS NO SILVER (OR GOLD) TO BE DELIVERED UPON AT THE COMEX AS THEY MUST EXPORT THEIR OBLIGATION TO LONDON. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE CAN BE A DELAY OF 24 HRS IN THE ISSUING OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nACCUMULATION FOR EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S/SILVER/ STARTING FROM FIRST DAY NOTICE/FOR MONTH OF JANUARY:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n37,797 CONTRACTS (FOR 17 TRADING DAYS TOTAL 37,797 CONTRACTS OR 188.98 MILLION OZ: AVERAGE PER DAY: 2223 CONTRACTS OR 11.116 MILLION OZ/DAY)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AS TO THE HUGE SUPPLY THIS MONTH IN SILVER: SO FAR THIS MONTH: 188.98 MILLION PAPER OZ HAVE MORPHED OVER TO LONDON. THIS REPRESENTS AROUND 26.99% OF ANNUAL GLOBAL PRODUCTION&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRESULT: A TINY SIZED LOSS IN OI COMEX DESPITE THE 6 CENT LOSS IN SILVER PRICE WHICH USUALLY INDICATES ANOTHER FAILED BANKER SHORT-COVERING. WE ALSO HAD A HUGE SIZED EFP ISSUANCE OF 2598 CONTRACTS WHICH EXITED OUT OF THE SILVER COMEX AND TRANSFERRED THEIR OI TO LONDON AS FORWARDS. SPECULATORS CONTINUED THEIR INTEREST IN ATTACKING THE SILVER COMEX FOR PHYSICAL SILVER . FROM THE CME DATA 2598 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S WERE ISSUED FOR TODAY FOR A DELIVERABLE FORWARD CONTRACT OVER IN LONDON WITH A FIAT BONUS. WE REALLY GAINED 2522 OI CONTRACTS i.e. 2598 open interest contracts headed for London (EFP&#92;&#92;u2019s) TOGETHER WITH A DECREASE OF 76 OI COMEX CONTRACTS. AND ALL OF THIS HAPPENED WITH THE FALL IN PRICE OF SILVER OF 6 CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF &#36;16.92 WITH RESPECT TO YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING. YET WE STILL HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF SILVER STANDING AT THE COMEX.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn ounces AT THE COMEX, the OI is still represented by just UNDER 1 BILLION oz i.e. 0.999 BILLION TO BE EXACT or 141% of annual global silver production (ex Russia &amp; ex China).&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFOR THE NEW FRONT JANUARY MONTH/ THEY FILED: 10 NOTICE(S) FOR 50,000 OZ OF SILVER&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn gold, the open interest SURPRISINGLY ROSE BY A CONSIDERABLE 9126 CONTRACTS UP TO582,421 WITH THE GOOD SIZED RISE IN PRICE OF GOLD WITH YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING (&#36;5.55). IN ANOTHER HUGE DEVELOPMENT, WE RECEIVED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GOLD EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S ISSUED FOR WEDNESDAY AND IT TOTALED A HUMONGOUS SIZED 12,223 CONTRACTS OF WHICH FEBRUARY SAW 11,023 CONTRACTS ISSUED AND APRIL SAW THE ISSUANCE OF 1200 CONTRACTS. The new OI for the gold complex rests at 583,590. ALSO REMEMBER THAT THERE CAN BE A DELAY IN THE ISSUANCE OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S. THE BANKERS REMOVE LONG POSITIONS OF COMEX GOLD IMMEDIATELY. THEN THEY ORCHESTRATE THEIR PRIVATE EFP DEAL WITH THE LONGS AND THAT COULD TAKE AN ADDITIONAL 48 HRS SO WE GENERALLY DO NOT GET A MATCH WITH RESPECT TO DEPARTING COMEX LONGS AND NEW EFP LONG TRANSFERS. DEMAND FOR GOLD INTENSIFIES GREATLY AS WE CONTINUE TO WITNESS A HUGE NUMBER OF EFP TRANSFERS TOGETHER WITH THE MASSIVE INCREASE IN GOLD COMEX OI TOGETHER WITH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOLD OUNCES STANDING FOR JANUARY COMEX. EVEN THOUGH THE BANKERS ISSUED THESE MONSTROUS EFPS, THE OBLIGATION STILL RESTS WITH THE BANKERS TO SUPPLY METAL BUT IT TRANSFERS THE RISK TO A LONDON BANKER OBLIGATION AND NOT A NEW YORK COMEX OBLIGATION. LONGS RECEIVE A FIAT BONUS TOGETHER WITH A LONG LONDON FORWARD. THUS, BY THESE ACTIONS, THE BANKERS AT THE COMEX HAVE JUST STATED THAT THEY HAVE NO APPRECIABLE METAL!! THIS IS A MASSIVE FRAUD: THEY CANNOT SUPPLY ANY METAL TO OUR COMEX LONGS BUT THEY ARE QUITE WILLING TO SUPPLY MASSIVE NON BACKED GOLD (AND SILVER) PAPER KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE NO METAL TO SATISFY OUR LONGS. LONDON IS NOW SEVERELY BACKWARD IN BOTH GOLD AND SILVER (BIG RISE IN BOTH GOFO AND SIFO) AND WE ARE WITNESSING DELAYS IN ACTUAL DELIVERIES. IN ESSENCE TODAY WE HAVE A HUGE GAIN OF 21,349 CONTRACTS: 9126 OI CONTRACTS INCREASED AT THE COMEX AND A GOOD SIZED 12,223 OI CONTRACTS WHICH NAVIGATED OVER TO LONDON. EXPECT HUGE NUMBERS OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S TO BE ISSUED AS WE APPROACH FIRST DAY NOTICE IN THE GOLD FEB COMEX CONTRACT, WEDNESDAY JAN 31.2018&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nYESTERDAY, WE HAD 11,759 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S ISSUED.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nACCUMULATION OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S/ GOLD(EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL) FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY STARTING WITH FIRST DAY NOTICE: 164,474 CONTRACTS OR 16.474 MILLION OZ OR 512.41 TONNES(17 TRADING DAYS AND THUS AVERAGING: 9674 EFP CONTRACTS PER TRADING DAY OR 967,400 OZ/DAY)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AS TO THE HUGE SIZE OF THESE EFP TRANSFERS : SO FAR THIS MONTH IN 17 TRADING DAYS: IN TONNES: 513 TONNES&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTOTAL ANNUAL GOLD PRODUCTION, 2017, THROUGHOUT THE WORLD EX CHINA EX RUSSIA: 2200 TONNES&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTHUS EFP TRANSFERS REPRESENTS 474/2200 TONNES = 23.31% OF GLOBAL ANNUAL PRODUCTION SO FAR IN JANUARY ALONE.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nResult: A SHOCKINGLY STRONG SIZED INCREASE IN OI AT THE COMEX WITH THE FAIR SIZED RISE IN PRICE IN GOLD TRADING ON YESTERDAY (&#36;5.55). WE HAD ANOTHER GIGANTIC SIZED NUMBER OF COMEX LONG TRANSFERRING TO LONDON THROUGH THE EFP ROUTE: 12,223. THERE OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH PHYSICAL GOLD AT THE COMEX AND YET WE ALSO OBSERVED A HUGE DELIVERY MONTH FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. I GUESS IT EXPLAINS THE HUGE ISSUANCE OF EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S&#92;&#92;u2026THERE IS HARDLY ANY GOLD PRESENT AT THE GOLD COMEX FOR DELIVERY PURPOSES. IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE 12,223 EFP CONTRACTS ISSUED, WE HAD A NET GAIN IN OPEN INTEREST OF 21,349 contracts ON THE TWO EXCHANGES:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n12,223 CONTRACTS MOVE TO LONDON AND 9,126 CONTRACTS INCREASED AT THE COMEX.

Today, we had the open interest in silver FELL BY A TINY 76 contracts from 200,061 DOWN TO 199,985 (AND now A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE NEW COMEX RECORD SET ON FRIDAY/APRIL 21/2017 AT 234,787) WITH THE FALL IN PRICE OF SILVER TO THE TUNE OF 5 CENTS WITH RESPECT TO YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING. OUR BANKERS USED THEIR EMERGENCY PROCEDURE TO ISSUE ANOTHER GOOD 2598 PRIVATE EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S FOR MARCH (WE DO NOT GET A LOOK AT THESE CONTRACTS AS IT IS PRIVATE BUT THE CFTC DOES AUDIT THEM) AND 0 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S FOR ALL OTHER MONTHS . EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S GIVE OUR COMEX LONGS A FIAT BONUS PLUS A DELIVERABLE PRODUCT OVER IN LONDON. WE HAD ZERO COMEX SILVER COMEX LIQUIDATION. IF WE TAKE THE OI LOSS AT THE COMEX OF 76 CONTRACTSTO THE 2598 OI TRANSFERRED TO LONDON THROUGH EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S WE OBTAIN A BIG GAIN OF 2522 OPEN INTEREST CONTRACTS. WE STILL HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF SILVER OUNCES THAT ARE STANDING FOR METAL IN JANUARY (SEE BELOW). THE NET GAIN TODAY IN OZ ON THE TWO EXCHANGES: 12.61 MILLION OZ!!!&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRESULT: A SMALL SIZED DECREASE IN SILVER OI AT THE COMEX DESPITE THE TINY FALL OF 6 CENTS IN PRICE (WITH RESPECT TO YESTERDAY&#92;&#92;u2019S TRADING). BUT WE ALSO HAD ANOTHER STRONG 2598 EFP&#92;&#92;u2019S ISSUED TRANSFERRING COMEX LONGS OVER TO LONDON. TOGETHER WITH THE GOOD SIZED AMOUNT OF SILVER OUNCES STANDING FOR JANUARY, DEMAND FOR PHYSICAL SILVER INTENSIFIES AS WE WITNESS MAJOR BANK SHORT COVERING ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASES IN GOFO AND SIFO RATES INDICATING SCARCITY.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n(report Harvey)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n2.a) The Shanghai and London gold fix report&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n(Harvey)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n2 b) Gold/silver trading overnight Europe, Goldcore&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n(Mark O&#92;&#92;u2019Byrne/zerohedge&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nand in NY: Bloomberg&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n3.

So America is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter,&#92;&#92;u201d the Rev.Samuel Rodriguez, who spoke at Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s inauguration last year, told Pelosi at a press conference on Thursday.&#92;&#92;u201d Prophetic? Really?&#92;&#92;u201d Pelosi, of course, is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected, coming second only to former President Barack Obama, champion of partial birth abortion. How sincere was Rev. Rodriguez when he raised the name of President Donald Trump in prayer at his inauguration? Discomfited by the president&#92;&#92;u2019s use of an expression he has denied using, Rev. Rodriguez, a member of the &#92;&#92;u201cunofficial&#92;&#92;u201d evangelical advisory board and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference noted that &#92;&#92;u201cevery single person is created in the image of God&#92;&#92;u201d and spoke of welcoming people equally from Nigeria and Norway, albeit after &#92;&#92;u201ca rigorous vetting process.&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u201cLater in the day, he said more: &#92;&#92;u201cIn addition, and with great due deference, I believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful. Why? Because when God looks at these nations, He sees His children.&#92;&#92;u201d (Yahoo, Jan. 15, 2018)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt should go without saying that our Creator sees among &#92;&#92;u201cHis children, millions of babies killed in their mother&#92;&#92;u2019s wombs. Sadly, the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president&#92;&#92;u2019s alleged use of the &#92;&#92;u2018s&#92;&#92;u2019 word as more preach-worthy than the open advocation of abortion. Isn&#92;&#92;u2019t it more than a tad hypocritical, if not downright sanctimonious that the Vatican newspaper, L&#92;&#92;u2019Osservatore Romano would try a wash-his-mouth-with-soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of President Donald Trump? We all know by now that President Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s alleged use of the &#92;&#92;u2018s&#92;&#92;u2019 word was tattle-taled to the Internet world by Catholic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been &#92;&#92;u201crepeatedly&#92;&#92;u201d used at a White House meeting on immigration. Tattletale Dicky Durbin&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nContinued below... The newspaper, L&#92;&#92;u2019Osservatore Romano&#92;&#92;u2014the Vatican&#92;&#92;u2019s flagship&#92;&#92;u2014gave Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s comments about the immigration debate in the United States, front page attention, noting the comments had immediately sparked &#92;&#92;u201ccontroversy and indignation&#92;&#92;u201d. Never mind that Trump denies using the term. Mercifully, the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the Democrats into a full-on faux rage. No, none of that over here. But it&#92;&#92;u2019s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up. Some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as&#92;&#92;u2014if not more&#92;&#92;u2014offensive to the Faithful. Some some pro-life Catholics must have thought of the &#92;&#92;u2018s&#92;&#92;u2019 word when reading on Twitter that abortion advocate Lilianne Ploumen, former Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation in the Netherlands, was recently honored by Pope Francis with the title of &#92;&#92;u2018Commander in the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great&#92;&#92;u2019. This was one Tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true: &#92;&#92;u201cThe Lepanto Institute was able to confirm from a December 22, 2017 Dutch radio broadcast that Ploumen indeed received the honor. In a brief video clip promoting the broadcast, Ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the Pope. (Lepanto Institute, Jan.12, 2018)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cTo say that Lilianne Ploumen is &#92;&#92;u201cpro-abortion&#92;&#92;u201d is an extreme understatement and doesn&#92;&#92;u2019t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism. &#92;&#92;u201cIn January of last year, after US President Donald Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, Ploumen launched a new NGO called She Decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the US government. The Mexico City Policy automatically denies US funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion. &#92;&#92;u201cReferring to the Mexico City Policy as a &#92;&#92;u201cGlobal Gag Rule,&#92;&#92;u201d Ploumen stated that the intention of She Decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA), the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International. She said, &#92;&#92;u201cThese are successful and effective programs: direct support, distributing condoms, making sure women are accompanied at the birth, and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice.&#92;&#92;u201d The LePanto Institute continues their Ploumen profile: &#92;&#92;u201cBut Ploumen&#92;&#92;u2019s anti-Catholic activity isn&#92;&#92;u2019t restricted to abortion. In September of 2017, Ploumen participated in the United Nations LGBTI Core Group. As the first speaker at the event, Ploumen noted that &#92;&#92;u201cLGBTI rights are human rights.&#92;&#92;u201d In her opening remarks, she said, &#92;&#92;u201cWe cannot be complacent. [Today] in more than 70 countries homosexuality is still criminalized&#92;&#92;u2026stigma against LGBT people continue all over the world.&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u201cIn 2014, Ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of Uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same-sex &#92;&#92;u201cmarriage.&#92;&#92;u201d In February of 2010, Ploumen called on LGBT activists to descend upon and disrupt Mass at St. John the Baptist Cathedral, wearing pink triangles with the words &#92;&#92;u201cJesus excludes no one.&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u201cThe reason? She and other pro-LGBT activists were protesting the Church&#92;&#92;u2019s moral teaching regarding homosexuality.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nContinued below... We already know how Pope Francis profiles President Donald Trump: &#92;&#92;u201cIn 2016, in response to a question about then-candidate Trump&#92;&#92;u2019s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, Francis said a man with such views was &#92;&#92;u201cnot Christian&#92;&#92;u201d. (Reuters, Jan. 12, 2018) &#92;&#92;u201cTrump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family, shot back saying it was &#92;&#92;u201cdisgraceful&#92;&#92;u201d for the pope to question his faith.&#92;&#92;u201d Actions speak so much louder than cuss words. Thousands will be taking part in the 2018 March for Life today. Neither Rev. Rodriguez nor Pope Francis will be there, but President Trump will be, addressing the crowd by satellite.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nCopyright &#92;&#92;u00a9 Canada Free Press&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRSS Feed for Judi McLeod&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nJudi McLeod is an award-winning journalist with 30 years&#92;&#92;u2019 experience in the print media.

for individual rights in education campus free speech rating system institutions which hold yellow light speech code rating are defined as ones that have at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application the university of alabama has three policies that egregiously violate students first amendment rights those policies deal with university space event advertisement and event planning students can only use university space if an event is in accordance with the priorities of the designated area alabama also restricts where students can pass out advertisements for an approved event and the administration requires all advertisements to be in good taste the administration makes final rulings on what qualifies as good taste things like ground use restrictions really damage the ability of students to share ideas freely and openly zach warren president of the university of alabama young americans for liberty chapter told red alert politics on our campus any hand outs must be approved so when we hand out pocket constitutions those technically have to be submitted weeks in advance for approval these policies allow for administrative overreach and enable the administration to ignore students rights to free expression on campus another example of yellow light policy is alabama event planning policy which requires students to submit an online event planning form seven to ten business days before an event an event that requires such steps include ks parades and demonstrations or marches in the university opinion these policies are designed to avoid scheduling conflicts and to allocate resources effectively taylor bryant university of alabama director of communications told red alert politics in an email that these policies supposedly help ensure the safety of our students and campus community and offers all campus affiliated parties the same opportunities without disrupting the university ability to provide its essential services of teaching and learning our grounds use permit policy allows campus affiliates to request the space that meets their needs and helps university staff coordinate appropriate campus resources security grounds keeping etc and avoid scheduling conflicts bryant stated these policies have been abused by ua in the past as seen in october when ua imposed security fee on the ua college republicans chapter for bringing milo yiannopoulos to campus after initially expecting fee of ua continually increased the amount of the required security fee as the event drew near only after experiencing significant pushback from students did the university rescind the fee and allow the event to go on as planned while policies like those at university alabama are not unique what makes them especially egregious are the layers upon layers of red tape that the university puts on students to exercise their first amendment rights said alexander staudt director of free speech at young americans for liberty whether it is restricting space use based on the priorities of that area or requiring good taste stamp of approval from administration for advertisements these policies
