an hour&#92;&#92;u2019s time, Jamie Dimon will sit down before the Senate Banking Committee and prove, once again, not only who is smarter and calls the shots in the great Wall Street-D.C. soap opera, but that when it comes to purchasing a room full of senators (not to mention the script for today&#92;&#92;u2019s &#92;&#92;u201chearing&#92;&#92;u201d), JP Morgan is always at the top. Because as the following table compiled using OpenSecrets data, it cost JP Morgan just under &#36;&#36;1 million, or &#36;&#36;877,798.00 to be precise in lifetime campaign contributions, to buy itself precisely one Senate Banking Committee. And where it gets really fun is that between the Chairman, Tim Johnson (D &#92;&#92;u2013 SD), and the ranking member Richard Shelby (R &#92;&#92;u2013 AL), JP Morgan has been the top and second biggest campaign contributor, respectively.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nContinue Reading at ZeroHedge.com&#92;&#92;u2026&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nRead more at Financial Survival Network&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nSource:&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2017-11-27T01:14:08.7454&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;The Cost Of The Best Senate Banking Committee JP Morgan Can Buy: &#36;&#36;877,798 In Bribes&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;source&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;Unnamed: 0&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;7119&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;id&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;3867639.0&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;domain&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;dailycurrant.com&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;satire&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;http://dailycurrant.com/2016/01/18/man-awoken-from-27-year-coma-commits-suicide-after-learning-donald-trump-leads-presidential-race/&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Man Awoken From 27-Year Coma Commits Suicide After Learning Donald Trump Leads Presidential Race&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nFatal error: Call to undefined function the_subheading() in /home2/dailycu/public_html/wp-content/themes/themefit_hybrid/themefit-hybrid/inc/meta.php on line 2&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;scraped_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2017-11-27T01:14:21.395055&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;inserted_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;updated_at&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Man Awoken From 27-Year Coma Commits Suicide After Learning Donald Trump Leads Presidential Race&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;authors&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;keywords&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;meta_keywords&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;[&#x27;&#x27;]&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;meta_description&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;tags&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;summary&#92;&quot;:null,&#92;&quot;source&#92;&quot;:null},{&#92;&quot;Unnamed: 0&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1518&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;id&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;9560791.0&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;domain&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;nytimes.com&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;type&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;reliable&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;url&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DC163CF930A35757C0A9659D8B63&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;content&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;WHEN Julia Geist was asked to draw a picture of a computer scientist last year, the 16-year-old sketched a businessman wearing glasses and a tie. Looking around at her classmates&#92;&#92;u2019 drawings, she saw similar depictions of men.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNow, Ms. Geist said, &#92;&#92;u201cI see a computer scientist could be anyone&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u2014 including herself.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nHer new perspective is a victory for Girls Who Code. As part of an eight-week program with the Manhattan-based nonprofit group, Ms. Geist and 19 other high school girls learned software programming, public speaking, product development and other skills to prepare them for jobs in the technology industry.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nGirls Who Code is among the recent crop of programs intended to close the gender gap in tech by intervening early, when young women are deciding what they want to study. With names like Hackbright Academy, Girl Develop It, Black Girls Code and Girls Teaching Girls to Code, these groups try to present a more exciting image of computer science.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe paucity of women in the tech industry has been well documented. Even though women represent more than half the overall work force, they hold less than a quarter of computing and technical jobs, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology based at the University of Colorado, Boulder. At the executive and founder levels, women are even scarcer.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nA variety of advocacy and networking groups have tried to address the problem by coaching women on building start-ups, raising venture capital and climbing the management ranks at big companies. Most recently, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published a best-selling book, &#92;&#92;u201cLean In,&#92;&#92;u201d that was a call to arms for women to pursue their ambition in the workplace.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nEven so, the number of women entering technology has been declining. Women earn just 12 percent of computer science degrees, down from 37 percent in 1984. Tech executives, recruiters and financiers say women simply do not walk through their doors seeking work.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cWe actively recruit women, but there&#92;&#92;u2019s just not that many women who want to do this kind of work and are equipped to do the work from their education,&#92;&#92;u201d said Adam Messinger, the chief technology officer at Twitter, who is on the board of Girls Who Code.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nSo the industry is trying a new approach. It is tackling the problem long before women start their careers, by teaching girls the basic skill of writing code.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cWe have to get women on the right side of the computer,&#92;&#92;u201d said Margit Wennmachers, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. Knowing a programming language is becoming essential not just for engineers, she added, but also for women who want to be tech executives or deal-makers or pursue other careers, from medicine to fashion.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cThe dividing line is learning to code,&#92;&#92;u201d Ms. Wennmachers said. &#92;&#92;u201cYou either tell the computer what to do and you&#92;&#92;u2019ve got lots of great career options. Or the computer tells you what to do and you end up working in a shoe store.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nGroups like Girls Who Code are part of a national movement to recruit young people to software development and remain competitive with other economies. A new group, code.org, for example, has people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft pushing for all schools to teach children to code.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBut the need is most urgent for girls, said Reshma Saujani, who founded Girls Who Code last year. Roughly 74 percent of girls in middle school express an interest in engineering, science and math, she said. But by the time they get to college, just 0.3 percent choose computer science as a major.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nMs. Saujani, the daughter of two engineers who were refugees from Uganda, developed the idea while she was running for Congress, a race that she lost. As she traveled from school to school on the campaign trail, she said she saw the same thing over and over: computer science classrooms without a single girl.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201cI saw the ability of technology to either enhance poverty or reduce it, and I saw girls not getting the same opportunities boys were,&#92;&#92;u201d said Ms. Saujani, who is now campaigning for public advocate in New York City. &#92;&#92;u201cBack in the &#92;&#92;u201960s, you didn&#92;&#92;u2019t have gender parity in law or medicine, but something happened and women started opting into these professions. We have to do that in computer science.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nResearchers say many factors contribute to girls&#92;&#92;u2019 reluctance to pursue computing as early as elementary school, including discouraging parents, inadequate resources for teachers and a lack of exposure. Studies have shown that girls imagine computer scientists as men working alone in a basement and can&#92;&#92;u2019t relate.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt&#92;&#92;u2019s a significant disconnect, given how women embrace technology. Female consumers make up a majority of users for many tech products.

This is general information on a law topic. Nothing in this diary constitutes legal advice and it is not to be acted upon as legal advice. If you need advice, get it from a skilled professional.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n. John Drake carries cash as part of his ATM service business and he would also like to carry a handgun. Finley Fenton is a reserve sheriff&#x27;s deputy who wants to carry a gun for self-protection while he is off duty. Other individual plaintiff/applicants were also denied permits. Two gun advocacy groups are also named plaintiffs - the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs and the Second Amendment Foundation.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe defendants are New Jersey officials who refused the permit applications and two Superior Court judges who upheld those decisions.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nSeven more gun advocacy groups, most of whom have routinely filed in recent carry cases, filed amicus &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;friend of the court&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; briefs supporting the plaintiffs.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNew Jersey Law. New Jersey is a &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;May Issue&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; state, one of about a dozen whose officials grant or deny gun carry permits under a broad standard such as a showing of need or good cause. (Unlike 43 states, New Jersey&#x27;s constitution does not have a version of the Second Amendment. A majority of states have &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Shall Issue&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; laws which require officials to grant a carry permit if certain statutorily specified conditions are met, such as demonstrations of safety awareness and maybe a background check. A few states have no permit requirements at all.)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTitle 13: Chapter 54-2.3 Criteria for the issuance of a permit to carry a handgun. (a) No application for a permit to carry a handgun shall be approved by a police chief of a municipality, the Superintendent or the Superior Court, unless the applicant: 1. Is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the disabilities ... as provided in this chapter;&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n2. Has demonstrated that at the time of the application for the permit he or she is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns; and&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n3. Has demonstrated a justifiable need to carry a handgun. (italics added)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nPlaintiff/applicants say the case presents two Second Amendment issues: (1) Is there a constitutional right to carry a handgun outside one&#x27;s home for self-defense? (2) Can the state of New Jersey require those who seek a permit to carry a handgun to prove a justifiable need?&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nPlaintiffs argue that because New Jersey carry permits must be renewed every two years and officials grant only about 1200 carry permits in that two-year period, the law is tantamount to no public carry rights at all.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nPlaintiffs&#x27; lawyer is Alan Gura, a well-known Second Amendment specialist who successfully argued the Heller and McDonald cases at the Supreme Court. Gura has been quoted in the New Jersey Herald as saying, &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Drake is about a state thumbing its nose at Supreme Court decisions that said the Second Amendment is about carrying in case of confrontation.&#92;&#92;u201d He added: &#92;&#92;u201cThis is about the Supreme Court enforcing what they have already pronounced.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nI respect Mr. Gura&#x27;s arguments in the courtroom, but that statement to a reporter is hyperbole. In the Heller and McDonald cases, the Supreme Court explicitly limited its rulings to a handgun for self-defense in one&#x27;s home, and that has been the settled law for almost six years. And New Jersey&#x27;s judges and public officials have shown no disrespect at all for the US Supreme Court in their rulings against Drake and the other applicants.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Issue and Argument of Defendants. New Jersey allows public carry, albeit that it severely restricts it. It contends only the second question is before the Court - the justifiable need aspect - and that is a question settled by New Jersey&#x27;s long-standing policy to restrict for public safety reasons public carry of firearms in civilian hands.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAs the Third Circuit Court of Appeals stated:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt is New Jersey&#92;&#92;u2019s judgment that when an individual carries a handgun in public for his or her own defense, he or she necessarily exposes members of the community to a somewhat heightened risk that they will be injured by that handgun. New Jersey has decided that this somewhat heightened risk to the public may be outweighed by the potential safety benefit to an individual with a &#92;&#92;u201cjustifiable need&#92;&#92;u201d to carry a handgun. Furthermore, New Jersey has decided that it can best determine when the individual benefit outweighs the increased risk to the community through careful case-by-case scrutiny of each application, by the police and a court.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe opinions of the District Court and Court of Appeals can be found as appendices to Drake&#x27;s Petition for Certiorari&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe NRA&#x27;s View. In its amicus filing, the NRA claims the first question totally resolves the case - that carry being a constitutional right, the state can&#x27;t require any showing of need. Such an absolutist view would go farther even than the Heller case where the Supreme Court allowed room for a host of &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;presumptively lawful regulatory measures.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nDrake&#x27;s Petition for Certiorari. This is a request to bring the record from the court below to SCOTUS. &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Cert&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; is granted if four of the nine Supreme Court justices vote for it in conference. If granted, briefs would be filed on the merits over the next several months and oral arguments would be scheduled for next fall.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nMore than 8000 cert requests are made during each nine month term but the Court grants argument for only about 80 cases. With only the rarest exceptions, no justice publicly discusses why the Court did or didn&#x27;t choose to hear a case.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhat considerations bear on granting cert? Typically, the most compelling is that lower Federal courts (and perhaps state courts, too) are divided, as they certainly are on the carry issue. Nevertheless, SCOTUS declined to take three cases on public carry within the last year: (1) Kachalsky v. Cacace challenging New York&#x27;s &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;proper cause&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; standard. (2) Woollard v. Gallagher, a challenge to Maryland&#x27;s permit law that requires a &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;good and substantial reason&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;; and (3) NRA v. McCraw from Texas, which also raised the issue whether the state could properly bar 18-20 year olds from buying a gun.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe argument against &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;May Issue&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; in Kachalsky and Woollard, as it is in Drake, was that the strict administration of the requirement for cause is equivalent to granting virtually no permits at all. There are other issues as well - how demanding the standard should be for judging &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;May Issue&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; laws, for example - but the threshold question is whether there is a Second Amendment right to carry in the first place.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOther Cases Coming. Is SCOTUS&#x27;s past pattern of not accepting carry cases necessarily a prologue? Other carry cases are coming through the Federal court pipeline. Possibly these have a bearing on what - and when - the Supreme Court will act on Drake.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNext to come for review is likely to be Peruta v. County of San Diego. California law allows each city and county to interpret the state&#x27;s &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;good cause&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; standard for issuing concealed carry permits as it chooses. San Diego County took a restrictive approach, requiring elaborate documentation and the showing of &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;a set of circumstances that distinguish the applicant from the mainstream and causes him or her to be placed in harm&#x27;s way.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; Edward Peruta (who lives in California part of the year) and several other applicants could not show any specific threats against them. The County sheriff concluded they did not qualify for carry permits.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Federal District Court held in Peruta that Heller does not stand for the broad proposition that all concealed weapon bans are presumptively constitutional. The next question, as it is in cases where the constitutionality of a statute is at issue, is the level of scrutiny to apply - how strict are the standards a court should use to decide if the statute complies with the constitution. SCOTUS explicitly left this undecided in Heller.)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe District Court applied intermediate scrutiny, finding that the County&#x27;s policy favoring public safety and reducing the rate of gun use in crime was &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;reasonably related to a &#x27;significant,&#x27; &#x27;substantial,&#x27; or &#x27;important&#x27; governmental interest. Moreover:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe government also has an important interest in reducing the number of concealed handguns in public because of their disproportionate involvement in life-threatening crimes of violence, particularly in streets and other public places.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Ninth Circuit reversed, holding (2-1) that to &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;bear arms&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; meant to carry them and that SCOTUS&#x27;s Heller decision pointed in favor of allowing carry for the purpose of confrontational self-defense. The Court declared that a constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public was so strong that the County&#x27;s application of &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;good cause&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; was too restrictive no matter what level of scrutiny applied.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe decision was by a three panel, as is the case with almost all Federal appellate court&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;ndecisions. However, a losing party can ask the full court to hear the case en banc. (The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has 45 judges, 16 of whom have senior status and a reduced workload, if any, so 29 are available. I understand the practice in the Ninth Circuit to be that it 11 judges would hear an en banc reargument, although it rarely grants one.)&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nMatters got complicated when San Diego County announced it would not appeal and planned to start issuing carry permits when the decision became final. That prompted California Attorney General Kamala Harris to petition for en banc review. The State of California had not been a party to the case, so it asked to intervene as did the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and - jointly - the California Police Chiefs Association and the California Peace Officers Association.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAs of May 2, the requests to intervene and for en banc reconsideration remain pending. It took three years (!) for the Peruta case to get from the US District Court&#x27;s decision to that three-judge Ninth Circuit decision. There is no particular reason to think the Ninth Circuit will act swiftly.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nObservations. An interesting facet of Drake&#x27;s case is that unlike most states, New Jersey statutes do not seem to distinguish between carrying a firearm openly or concealed. Attorney Gura argues that this makes his case a better one for SCOTUS to decide:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNor does it involve any difficult questions as to time, place or manner restrictions on the carrying of handguns. Because New Jersey&#92;&#92;u2019s law operates without distinction between the concealed and open carrying of handguns, confusing questions as to the manner in which Petitioners might exercise their rights are avoided.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWhether Drake is a purer, less confusing case is debatable. NJ courts have discretion to impose the types of conditions that the applicants argue are not present in this case.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nSo, John Drake&#x27;s case is in waiting. Speculation abounds on why it was relisted for a third time.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAfter all, this current Supreme Court seems quite willing to accept controversial issues. Are some justices deterred by the strong presence of diverse &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;states&#x27; rights&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; policies on firearms matters? Even after almost six years since Heller, is SCOTUS still reluctant to enter into its next Second Amendment ruling? Are the justices awaiting another case, possibly Peruta? Is one of the majority justices in Heller waffling, making the others worried about the outcome of the next gun rights case?&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAll this, of course, is completely speculative.

The analysis by the Center for Climate and Security identifies 12 &#92;&#92;u201cepicenters&#92;&#92;u201d where climate change could stress global security, possibly igniting conflicts around the world. American diplomats and military planners have already started grappling with some of these problems&#92;&#92;u2014but the links between them do not get enough attention, the experts said. And it is an open question whether the Trump administration confronts those challenges or tries to ignore them.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nI think we all know the answer to that last question.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nHere are the 12 epicenters:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n1. Eroding Sovereignty: Climate change will make it harder for governments to provide basic necessities, increasing the likelihood of unrest.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n2. Water Towers: Billions of people are dependent on &#92;&#92;u201cwater towers&#92;&#92;u201d &#92;&#92;u2014 mountains covered with snow and ice that melts, feeding streams and rivers below. As that water grows scarce, tensions will rise.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n3. Atlantis 2.0: Low-lying islands like the Maldives may disappear altogether, creating a refugee crisis.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n4. Dire Straits: Maritime trade routes will be stressed by the change in patterns of trade that climate change will create, as well as more directly. The Panama Canal, for example, uses fresh water to move ships through its locks (54 million gallons for each ship).&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n5. Nuclear &amp; Climate: Climate change will increase nuclear risk.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n6. Health Security: Climate change may increase global pandemics.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n7. Coastal Megacities: The rapidly growing coastal cities of the world may be flooded by rising sea levels, destabilizing nations.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n8. Water Weaponization: Terrorists are already using water as a weapon; climate change is likely to make it worse.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n9. A Melting Arctic: Vanishing ice will make the Arctic more accessible, increasing the likelihood of conflict over its resources.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n10.

(the production received funds from the alfred p. sloan foundation, which supports plays about science.) this also makes &#92;&#92;u201cheadstrong&#92;&#92;u201d seem out of date, since what merritt is trying to prove &#92;&#92;u2014 that ordinary hits are as dangerous as those that cause concussions &#92;&#92;u2014 has been explored thoroughly in the news media.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nstaged with measured solemnity by william carden, this play of ideas unfolds like a series of dramatized arguments. an anguished mr. gemignani emphasizes the insecurity of his character, a former amateur athlete in awe of the professionals. the detour into the politics of merritt&#92;&#92;u2019s foundation is another oddly bland choice, but the play eventually moves back to troy, who captures the excitement of the field in his stories of old games.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nsylvia confronts her father about the dangers of the sport but seems to come to terms with the meaning it has given to their lives. to its credit the play raises perhaps the thorniest part of this issue: the possibility that our worst fears about football are true, but that even if they were widely publicized, few would care enough to stop cheering.&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;a wonderfully exciting game that just happens to kill its own

department of public safety (dps) trooper.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nlate wednesday evening, the dps announced it will fire the trooper, the ap reported.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nthe grand jury met on several occasions over a period of months since the incident where dps trooper brian encinia arrested a black woman, sandra bland, following a traffic stop. bland hung herself to death in the waller county jail after being held for three days. her family had not posted the &#36;5,000 bond for her release.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;ndarrell jordan, one of five special prosecutors appointed to oversee the investigation into bland&#92;&#92;u2019s death spoke with breitbart texas following the announcement of the indictment. jordan said the grand jury did not believe encinia&#92;&#92;u2019s statement in the probable cause affidavit where he said, &#92;&#92;u201ci had bland exit the vehicle to further conduct a safe traffic investigation.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;njordan said the grand jury had been meeting since august, 2015. they met multiple times during their investigation into the trooper, the sheriff and the jailers. the misdemeanor perjury charge, a class a misdemeanor, was the only indictment returned by the grand jury.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nwhen asked by breitbart texas if there could be any further indictments, jordan said &#92;&#92;u201cit is always open for a possibility, but not likely.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;u201csome people are going to be upset, and that is understandable,&#92;&#92;u201d jordan explained, &#92;&#92;u201cbut i, as a prosecutor, must see that justice has been done. it has been through the grand jury process and this is what the grand jury decided.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nbreitbart texas also spoke with waller county sheriff glenn smith on the steps of the courthouse following the announcement of the indictment. smith said he was relieved that neither he nor any of his jail staff were indicted.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nthe grand jury reported in december that no indictments would be handed down against the sheriff or his staff.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nsmith sounded sad when talking about the death of bland in his custody. &#92;&#92;u201cthis is the second person that has died in jail since i became sheriff,&#92;&#92;u201d smith said. &#92;&#92;u201ci do not want this to happen again.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nthe sheriff said that two of his jailers have left his employment since bland&#92;&#92;u2019s death. &#92;&#92;u201cit has been hard on us,&#92;&#92;u201d he said. &#92;&#92;u201cwe are working hard to take care of those who are still with us and are making changes to make certain this does not happen again.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nthe sheriff said the waller county commissioners court has approved a new budget that increased funds for the jail. &#92;&#92;u201cwe have promoted captain brian cantrell to chief deputy in charge of jail operations,&#92;&#92;u201d smith explained. &#92;&#92;u201che is making changes that include a new electronic logging system where jailers will log, in real time, their hourly visits to the jail to check on the inmates&#92;&#92;u2019 welfare.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nsmith said they missed one of those hourly visits in bland&#92;&#92;u2019s case. &#92;&#92;u201ci do not know if that would have made a difference or not, but we do not want this to happen again.&#92;&#92;u201d the sheriff said the county has approved funds to have more jailers on the floor at all times.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;na report of jail improvement recommendations prepared by attorney paul looney has not yet been formally presented to the sheriff. &#92;&#92;u201cwe expect to get it soon,&#92;&#92;u201d smith said, &#92;&#92;u201cbut i have spoken with looney on the phone and he has prepared about seven or eight recommendations.&#92;&#92;u201d the sheriff said some of those have already been put into place.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nthe sheriff expressed sadness several times while talking with reporters on the courthouse steps. &#92;&#92;u201cit is a personal matter to us,&#92;&#92;u201d he said. &#92;&#92;u201cnot like to the families, but it is still very personal. we take this very seriously.&#92;&#92;u201d&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nif encinia is convicted of the
