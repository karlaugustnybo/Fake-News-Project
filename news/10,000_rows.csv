(Before It's News)

from Zero Hedge

In about an hour’s time, Jamie Dimon will sit down before the Senate Banking Committee and prove, once again, not only who is smarter and calls the shots in the great Wall Street-D.C. soap opera, but that when it comes to purchasing a room full of senators (not to mention the script for today’s “hearing”), JP Morgan is always at the top. Because as the following table compiled using OpenSecrets data, it cost JP Morgan just under $$1 million, or $$877,798.00 to be precise in lifetime campaign contributions, to buy itself precisely one Senate Banking Committee. And where it gets really fun is that between the Chairman, Tim Johnson (D – SD), and the ranking member Richard Shelby (R – AL), JP Morgan has been the top and second biggest campaign contributor, respectively.

Looking around at her classmates’ drawings, she saw similar depictions of men.

Now, Ms. Geist said, “I see a computer scientist could be anyone” — including herself.

Her new perspective is a victory for Girls Who Code. As part of an eight-week program with the Manhattan-based nonprofit group, Ms. Geist and 19 other high school girls learned software programming, public speaking, product development and other skills to prepare them for jobs in the technology industry.

Girls Who Code is among the recent crop of programs intended to close the gender gap in tech by intervening early, when young women are deciding what they want to study. With names like Hackbright Academy, Girl Develop It, Black Girls Code and Girls Teaching Girls to Code, these groups try to present a more exciting image of computer science.

The paucity of women in the tech industry has been well documented. Even though women represent more than half the overall work force, they hold less than a quarter of computing and technical jobs, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology based at the University of Colorado, Boulder. At the executive and founder levels, women are even scarcer.

A variety of advocacy and networking groups have tried to address the problem by coaching women on building start-ups, raising venture capital and climbing the management ranks at big companies. Most recently, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published a best-selling book, “Lean In,” that was a call to arms for women to pursue their ambition in the workplace.

Even so, the number of women entering technology has been declining. Women earn just 12 percent of computer science degrees, down from 37 percent in 1984. Tech executives, recruiters and financiers say women simply do not walk through their doors seeking work.

“We actively recruit women, but there’s just not that many women who want to do this kind of work and are equipped to do the work from their education,” said Adam Messinger, the chief technology officer at Twitter, who is on the board of Girls Who Code.

So the industry is trying a new approach. It is tackling the problem long before women start their careers, by teaching girls the basic skill of writing code.

“We have to get women on the right side of the computer,” said Margit Wennmachers, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. Knowing a programming language is becoming essential not just for engineers, she added, but also for women who want to be tech executives or deal-makers or pursue other careers, from medicine to fashion.

“The dividing line is learning to code,” Ms. Wennmachers said. “You either tell the computer what to do and you’ve got lots of great career options. Or the computer tells you what to do and you end up working in a shoe store.”

Groups like Girls Who Code are part of a national movement to recruit young people to software development and remain competitive with other economies. A new group, code.org, for example, has people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft pushing for all schools to teach children to code.

But the need is most urgent for girls, said Reshma Saujani, who founded Girls Who Code last year. Roughly 74 percent of girls in middle school express an interest in engineering, science and math, she said. But by the time they get to college, just 0.3 percent choose computer science as a major.

Ms. Saujani, the daughter of two engineers who were refugees from Uganda, developed the idea while she was running for Congress, a race that she lost. As she traveled from school to school on the campaign trail, she said she saw the same thing over and over: computer science classrooms without a single girl.

“I saw the ability of technology to either enhance poverty or reduce it, and I saw girls not getting the same opportunities boys were,” said Ms. Saujani, who is now campaigning for public advocate in New York City. “Back in the ’60s, you didn’t have gender parity in law or medicine, but something happened and women started opting into these professions. We have to do that in computer science.”

Researchers say many factors contribute to girls’ reluctance to pursue computing as early as elementary school, including discouraging parents, inadequate resources for teachers and a lack of exposure. Studies have shown that girls imagine computer scientists as men working alone in a basement and can’t relate.

It’s a significant disconnect, given how women embrace technology. Female consumers make up a majority of users for many tech products. For technology companies, women also offer a diverse perspective, which can help bolster the bottom line.",2018-02-11 00:46:42.632962,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Opening a Gateway for Girls to Enter the Computer Field,,,"['Computers and the Internet', 'Women and Girls', 'Careers and Professions', 'Miller  Claire Cain']","WHEN Julia Geist was asked to draw a picture of a computer scientist last year, the 16-year-old sketched a businessman wearing glasses and a tie.

There is no shortage of research regarding the negative effects of a wide variety of vaccines. From Gardasil to the seasonal flu shot, studies have proven that the extreme risks associated with vaccinating oftentimes outweigh the minor benefits. Here is a fraction of the research (over 100 studies) tying vaccines to a host of health conditions, broken down by category:

Coulter described that central nervous system damage can be exhibited as abnormal behavior of the child. In 1935, Thomas Rivers, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) can be the result of a viral or bacterial infection of the nervous system. “The fact of the matter is that it is a matter of record that it was known that vaccination produced encephalitis since 1926.” The authors stated, “In regions in which there is no organized vaccination of the population, general paralysis is rare. … It is impossible to deny a connection between vaccinations and the encephalitis (brain damage) which follows it.” Vaccines have been linked to seizures, convulsions and epilepsy.

A review of these points indicates an underestimation of CNS complications after pertussis immunization.”

This is general information on a law topic. Nothing in this diary constitutes legal advice and it is not to be acted upon as legal advice. If you need advice, get it from a skilled professional.



. John Drake carries cash as part of his ATM service business and he would also like to carry a handgun. Finley Fenton is a reserve sheriff's deputy who wants to carry a gun for self-protection while he is off duty. Other individual plaintiff/applicants were also denied permits. Two gun advocacy groups are also named plaintiffs - the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs and the Second Amendment Foundation.

The defendants are New Jersey officials who refused the permit applications and two Superior Court judges who upheld those decisions.

Seven more gun advocacy groups, most of whom have routinely filed in recent carry cases, filed amicus ""friend of the court"" briefs supporting the plaintiffs.

New Jersey Law. New Jersey is a ""May Issue"" state, one of about a dozen whose officials grant or deny gun carry permits under a broad standard such as a showing of need or good cause. (Unlike 43 states, New Jersey's constitution does not have a version of the Second Amendment. A majority of states have ""Shall Issue"" laws which require officials to grant a carry permit if certain statutorily specified conditions are met, such as demonstrations of safety awareness and maybe a background check. A few states have no permit requirements at all.)



Title 13: Chapter 54-2.3 Criteria for the issuance of a permit to carry a handgun. (a) No application for a permit to carry a handgun shall be approved by a police chief of a municipality, the Superintendent or the Superior Court, unless the applicant: 1. Is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the disabilities ... as provided in this chapter;

2. Has demonstrated that at the time of the application for the permit he or she is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns; and

3. Has demonstrated a justifiable need to carry a handgun. (italics added)

Plaintiff/applicants say the case presents two Second Amendment issues: (1) Is there a constitutional right to carry a handgun outside one's home for self-defense? (2) Can the state of New Jersey require those who seek a permit to carry a handgun to prove a justifiable need?

Plaintiffs argue that because New Jersey carry permits must be renewed every two years and officials grant only about 1200 carry permits in that two-year period, the law is tantamount to no public carry rights at all.

Plaintiffs' lawyer is Alan Gura, a well-known Second Amendment specialist who successfully argued the Heller and McDonald cases at the Supreme Court. Gura has been quoted in the New Jersey Herald as saying, ""Drake is about a state thumbing its nose at Supreme Court decisions that said the Second Amendment is about carrying in case of confrontation.” He added: “This is about the Supreme Court enforcing what they have already pronounced.”

I respect Mr. Gura's arguments in the courtroom, but that statement to a reporter is hyperbole. In the Heller and McDonald cases, the Supreme Court explicitly limited its rulings to a handgun for self-defense in one's home, and that has been the settled law for almost six years. And New Jersey's judges and public officials have shown no disrespect at all for the US Supreme Court in their rulings against Drake and the other applicants.

The Issue and Argument of Defendants. New Jersey allows public carry, albeit that it severely restricts it. It contends only the second question is before the Court - the justifiable need aspect - and that is a question settled by New Jersey's long-standing policy to restrict for public safety reasons public carry of firearms in civilian hands.

As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals stated:



It is New Jersey’s judgment that when an individual carries a handgun in public for his or her own defense, he or she necessarily exposes members of the community to a somewhat heightened risk that they will be injured by that handgun. New Jersey has decided that this somewhat heightened risk to the public may be outweighed by the potential safety benefit to an individual with a “justifiable need” to carry a handgun. Furthermore, New Jersey has decided that it can best determine when the individual benefit outweighs the increased risk to the community through careful case-by-case scrutiny of each application, by the police and a court.

The opinions of the District Court and Court of Appeals can be found as appendices to Drake's Petition for Certiorari

The NRA's View. In its amicus filing, the NRA claims the first question totally resolves the case - that carry being a constitutional right, the state can't require any showing of need. Such an absolutist view would go farther even than the Heller case where the Supreme Court allowed room for a host of ""presumptively lawful regulatory measures.""

Drake's Petition for Certiorari. This is a request to bring the record from the court below to SCOTUS. ""Cert"" is granted if four of the nine Supreme Court justices vote for it in conference. If granted, briefs would be filed on the merits over the next several months and oral arguments would be scheduled for next fall.

More than 8000 cert requests are made during each nine month term but the Court grants argument for only about 80 cases. With only the rarest exceptions, no justice publicly discusses why the Court did or didn't choose to hear a case.

What considerations bear on granting cert? Typically, the most compelling is that lower Federal courts (and perhaps state courts, too) are divided, as they certainly are on the carry issue. Nevertheless, SCOTUS declined to take three cases on public carry within the last year: (1) Kachalsky v. Cacace challenging New York's ""proper cause"" standard. (2) Woollard v. Gallagher, a challenge to Maryland's permit law that requires a ""good and substantial reason""; and (3) NRA v. McCraw from Texas, which also raised the issue whether the state could properly bar 18-20 year olds from buying a gun.

The argument against ""May Issue"" in Kachalsky and Woollard, as it is in Drake, was that the strict administration of the requirement for cause is equivalent to granting virtually no permits at all. There are other issues as well - how demanding the standard should be for judging ""May Issue"" laws, for example - but the threshold question is whether there is a Second Amendment right to carry in the first place.

Other Cases Coming. Is SCOTUS's past pattern of not accepting carry cases necessarily a prologue? Other carry cases are coming through the Federal court pipeline. Possibly these have a bearing on what - and when - the Supreme Court will act on Drake.

Next to come for review is likely to be Peruta v. County of San Diego. California law allows each city and county to interpret the state's ""good cause"" standard for issuing concealed carry permits as it chooses. San Diego County took a restrictive approach, requiring elaborate documentation and the showing of ""a set of circumstances that distinguish the applicant from the mainstream and causes him or her to be placed in harm's way."" Edward Peruta (who lives in California part of the year) and several other applicants could not show any specific threats against them. The County sheriff concluded they did not qualify for carry permits.

The Federal District Court held in Peruta that Heller does not stand for the broad proposition that all concealed weapon bans are presumptively constitutional. The next question, as it is in cases where the constitutionality of a statute is at issue, is the level of scrutiny to apply - how strict are the standards a court should use to decide if the statute complies with the constitution. SCOTUS explicitly left this undecided in Heller.)

The District Court applied intermediate scrutiny, finding that the County's policy favoring public safety and reducing the rate of gun use in crime was ""reasonably related to a 'significant,' 'substantial,' or 'important' governmental interest. Moreover:



The government also has an important interest in reducing the number of concealed handguns in public because of their disproportionate involvement in life-threatening crimes of violence, particularly in streets and other public places.

The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding (2-1) that to ""bear arms"" meant to carry them and that SCOTUS's Heller decision pointed in favor of allowing carry for the purpose of confrontational self-defense. The Court declared that a constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public was so strong that the County's application of ""good cause"" was too restrictive no matter what level of scrutiny applied.

The decision was by a three panel, as is the case with almost all Federal appellate court

decisions. However, a losing party can ask the full court to hear the case en banc. (The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has 45 judges, 16 of whom have senior status and a reduced workload, if any, so 29 are available. I understand the practice in the Ninth Circuit to be that it 11 judges would hear an en banc reargument, although it rarely grants one.)

Matters got complicated when San Diego County announced it would not appeal and planned to start issuing carry permits when the decision became final. That prompted California Attorney General Kamala Harris to petition for en banc review. The State of California had not been a party to the case, so it asked to intervene as did the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and - jointly - the California Police Chiefs Association and the California Peace Officers Association.

As of May 2, the requests to intervene and for en banc reconsideration remain pending. It took three years (!) for the Peruta case to get from the US District Court's decision to that three-judge Ninth Circuit decision. There is no particular reason to think the Ninth Circuit will act swiftly.

Observations. An interesting facet of Drake's case is that unlike most states, New Jersey statutes do not seem to distinguish between carrying a firearm openly or concealed. Attorney Gura argues that this makes his case a better one for SCOTUS to decide:



Nor does it involve any difficult questions as to time, place or manner restrictions on the carrying of handguns. Because New Jersey’s law operates without distinction between the concealed and open carrying of handguns, confusing questions as to the manner in which Petitioners might exercise their rights are avoided.

Whether Drake is a purer, less confusing case is debatable. NJ courts have discretion to impose the types of conditions that the applicants argue are not present in this case.

So, John Drake's case is in waiting. Speculation abounds on why it was relisted for a third time.

After all, this current Supreme Court seems quite willing to accept controversial issues. Are some justices deterred by the strong presence of diverse ""states' rights"" policies on firearms matters? Even after almost six years since Heller, is SCOTUS still reluctant to enter into its next Second Amendment ruling? Are the justices awaiting another case, possibly Peruta? Is one of the majority justices in Heller waffling, making the others worried about the outcome of the next gun rights case?

All this, of course, is completely speculative. To be continued ...

2968,2015968.0,dailykos.com,political,"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/06/09/1670392/-Once-Again,-Climate-Change-Cited-as-Trigger-for-War","A new report identifies 12 ""epicenters"" worldwide where changing climate could spark conflict

The national security establishment needs to prepare for a series of global crises sparked by climate change, a group of experts wrote in a report released today. The analysis by the Center for Climate and Security identifies 12 “epicenters” where climate change could stress global security, possibly igniting conflicts around the world. American diplomats and military planners have already started grappling with some of these problems—but the links between them do not get enough attention, the experts said. And it is an open question whether the Trump administration confronts those challenges or tries to ignore them.

I think we all know the answer to that last question.

Here are the 12 epicenters:

1. Eroding Sovereignty: Climate change will make it harder for governments to provide basic necessities, increasing the likelihood of unrest.

2. Water Towers: Billions of people are dependent on “water towers” — mountains covered with snow and ice that melts, feeding streams and rivers below. As that water grows scarce, tensions will rise.

3. Atlantis 2.0: Low-lying islands like the Maldives may disappear altogether, creating a refugee crisis.

4. Dire Straits: Maritime trade routes will be stressed by the change in patterns of trade that climate change will create, as well as more directly. The Panama Canal, for example, uses fresh water to move ships through its locks (54 million gallons for each ship).

5. Nuclear & Climate: Climate change will increase nuclear risk.

6. Health Security: Climate change may increase global pandemics.

7. Coastal Megacities: The rapidly growing coastal cities of the world may be flooded by rising sea levels, destabilizing nations.

8. Water Weaponization: Terrorists are already using water as a weapon; climate change is likely to make it worse.

9. A Melting Arctic: Vanishing ice will make the Arctic more accessible, increasing the likelihood of conflict over its resources.

10. Fish and Conflict: A warming ocean will increase conflicts over fish stocks.

11. Coffee Conflict: Global trade networks that millions of people depend on will be disrupted.

12. Migration and Displacement: Climate change is a significant and growing driver of migration and displacement.

“The humanitarian effects of [climate change] are massive,” he said. “But what we’re saying is that those humanitarian consequences are likely to spill over into broader security problems that speaks to the heart of how the world organizes itself.”

""We say to our Republicans who want to privatize Medicare, we say: go try it. Make our day,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer said. | Getty Schumer accuses GOP of 'war on seniors' Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Future Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer trotted out a new messaging attack on Donald Trump and congressional Republicans on Tuesday, accusing the GOP of ""plotting a war on seniors"" with its plans to repeal Obamacare and potentially privatize Medicare. 
Faced with having to swallow Rep. Tom Price's (R-Ga.) nomination as Trump's secretary of health and human services, Schumer is hoping that unified Democratic opposition to privatizing health care plans for seniors can be a rallying point — as well as a political shield to save endangered Democratic senators. Senate Democrats are defending five Senate seats in deeply conservative states in 2018, but Schumer vowed that his entire caucus will oppose any effort to change the current single-payer Medicare system for seniors. Story Continued Below 
""Between this nomination of an avowed Medicare opponent and the Republicans here threatening to privatize Medicare it's clear that Washington Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year. Every senior, every American, should hear this loudly and clearly: Democrats will not let them win that fight,"" Schumer said. ""Democrats from blue states, purple states, red states are going to link arm-and-arm to protect Medicare for our seniors and ensure that Republicans don't succeed in putting our seniors healthcare at risk."" 
A bid to make changes to entitlement programs is most likely to start in the House, where House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has suggested that a repeal of Obamacare should be paired with changes to programs like Medicare. Price has likewise listed Medicare reform as a key priority for Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to address the matter on Tuesday and Trump has not voiced support for changing Medicare to a private insurance program. 
Given the lack of GOP unity on the issue, along with the voting strength of seniors, Medicare offers Schumer an opportunity to go on the offensive after Democrats were crushed on Election Day. And while Democrats retain the power to filibuster legislation in the Senate, Republicans could conceivably force through entitlement reforms via budget reconciliation, which allows passage of some legislation by a simple majority. 
But that would be far more difficult if Schumer and congressional Democrats are able to mount a sustained campaign against the GOP's ""war on seniors,"" a strategy reminiscent of their ""war on women"" messaging of past election cycles as well as the party's opposition to President George W. Bush's efforts to privatize Social Security. 
""Just as their efforts failed then, they will fail now. We say to our Republicans who want to privatize Medicare, we say: go try it. Make our day,"" Schumer said.

13,20.0,blackgenocide.org,conspiracy,http://blackgenocide.org/archived_articles/oppose.html,"Why We Oppose Planned Parent Hood ( The following is a reprint of the STOPP's essay ""Why We Oppose Planned Parenthood"") Planned Parenthood is not a benevolent organization trying to strengthen women's rights. It is a cold, calculating group intent on spreading the Humanist religion, luring our children into their web of premarital sex and unlimited abortions, reducing the population of minorities in particula and filling its coffers with the profits from sales of birth control devices. PP COMES BETWEEN PARENTS & CHILDREN



Planned Parenthood pushes what it calls “confidential services” for minors, meaning that PP will provide all types of “reproductive services” to young girls, including potentially dangerous prescription medication and invasive surgery, without their parents’ knowledge. In its 1993-1994 Annual Report, PP bragged of its “unswerving commitment to confidentiality.”



In most states, PP assigns teens a “code name” so that PP can call the girls at home and pretend to be a girlfriend. (Recently, the code names in Springfield, IL; Chicago, IL; and Kingston, NY; were Heather, Nancy and Lucy, respectively.)



As long ago as 1979, the Sunday Independent newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, PA, reported that Planned Parenthood was transporting high school girls out of town, during school hours, to get abortions without the parents being notified.



Planned Parenthood will give minor girls Norplant, Depo-Provera shots, and even abortions without their parents’ knowledge.



PP DOES NOT OPPOSE TEENAGE SEX



Planned Parenthood does not view teenage sex as wrong. PP is upset only if sex results in “unwanted” births. Planned Parenthood’s sex education programs are not about telling children how to avoid sex. They are, rather, designed to indoctrinate our children into what PP calls “responsible sexuality.” By this PP means it is okay for kids to have sex as long as they avoid pregnancy; or if they do get pregnant, have an abortion.



Former PP president Faye Wattleton confirmed this in the Los Angeles Times, on October 17, 1986: “[Planned Parenthood is] not going to be an organization promoting celibacy or chastity.”



The current PP president, Pamela Maraldo, in an article in the March/April 1993 issue of Family Planning World, condemned abstinence-only sex ed programs as “unacceptable.” She endorsed, instead, the position of former United States Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who said, “We’ve taught our children in driver’s education what to do in the front seat, and now we’ve got to teach them what to do in the back seat.”



PP SPREADS RELIGION OF HUMANISM



Planned Parenthood is dedicated to spreading the religious doctrine of Humanism as defined in the Humanist Manifestos (I & II).



PP has consistently refused to give our children a clear message of “right” and “wrong.” It seeks not to educate our children in moral values, but to indoctrinate them into the Humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code, and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual.



In the Los Angeles Times article quoted above, Faye Wattleton said, “[Planned Parenthood’s] concern is not to convey ‘shoulds’ or ‘should nots.’”



Fearing that moral people on school boards may lead to schools teaching our young children right from wrong, Pamela Maraldo said, in the article referred to above, “...we must bring an immediate halt to the aggressive infiltration of local school boards by the religious right.”



Any school program endorsed by Planned Parenthood will give children complete information on how to have sex. The children will be given no moral guidance in a PP program and will be told they can do it or not do it depending on how they feel. While this concept of no absolute rights or wrongs may be embraced by some people in the world, it is rejected by most. Most people subscribe to religious principles that recognize a supreme authority over life and a set of divinely inspired principles on which our behavior must be conditioned. Parents who support STOPP are among this latter group and, therefore, oppose all PP programs for teens.



PP POSES A DANGER TO WOMEN



Planned Parenthood runs a business providing birth control devices to its customers. Although PP is officially a non-profit organization, IRS regulations allow it to make profits on parts of its operation. PP does make a profit on its sale of birth control devices and seems to operate more to protect that income than its clients.



A primary example of this is their provision of birth control pills. The Pill has long been a major income producer for PP.



At the Third Annual AIDS Conference in Washington in June 1987, Dr. Frank Plummer of the Kenya Medical Institute reported that oral contraceptive users appear to be less resistant to AIDS than non-users. Still PP refused to get teenage girls and others off the Pill.



Then, Family Planning Perspectives (Vol. 25, No. 6, p. 243) reported: “Women who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and use the pill are more likely than nonusers to have HIV present in their cervical secretions, and may be more likely to infect their sexual partners.” The AGI story goes on to say: “The presence of HIV in cervical secretions was nearly 12 times as likely among pill users as among non-users.”



Still, PP refused to tell its customers to get off the Pill to reduce the risk of AIDS. If PP were really concerned about women, it would stop selling the Pill. However, this would mean about an $85,000,000 decrease in PP income.



This same disregard for women can also be seen in Planned Parenthood’s handling of the Norplant problem. In 1993 and 1994, numerous lawsuits were filed by Norplant users over the side effects of the implants and the difficulty of removal. Yet PP not only continues to make this device available, it still implants it in minors without parental knowledge.

The spider’s venom causes localised pain, minor swelling and, in extreme cases, nausea. If the bite becomes infected, it can lead to a gangrene-like infection.

It is believed that the false widow was first imported to Britain in bunches of bananas from its native homelands of Madeira and the Canary Islands. The first sighting of a noble false widow was in 1879 in Torquay but the species has since spread across southern England. False widow spiders have now started to spread further northward, probably due to global warming.

How can you spot a false widow spider? Noble false widow spiders have brown shiny abdomens and a distributive white marking, which some people have compared to a skull. The females range in size from 8.5mm to 14mm long while the males are just 7mm to 10mm long, according to the British Arachnological Society. Other false widow species, nicknamed ‘cupboard spiders’ and ‘rabbit hutch spiders’, are smaller in size and much more harmless. Look out for noble false widow spiders in dark corners of your house and window frames as well as in your garden and shed.

EFF and ACLU SoCal argued in a brief filed today with the California Supreme Court that citizens needs access to automated license plate reader (ALPR) records to understand exactly how this intrusive technology is used.

ALPRs are high-speed cameras mounted on light poles and police cars that continuously scan the plates of every passing car. They collect not only the license plate number but also the time, date, and location of each plate scanned, along with a photograph of the vehicle and sometimes its occupants. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) collect, on average, three million plate scans every week and have amassed a database of half a billion records.

EFF filed public records requests for a week’s worth of ALPR data from the agencies and, along with ACLU SoCal, sued after both refused to release the records.

EFF and ACLU SoCal are now asking the state supreme court to overturn aruling in the case from a lower court that said all license plate data—collected indiscriminately and without suspicion that the vehicle or driver was involved in a crime—could be withheld from disclosure as “records of law enforcement investigations.”

“That argument is tantamount to saying all drivers in Los Angeles are under criminal investigation at all times,’’ said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Jennifer Lynch. “The ruling sets a troubling standard that would not just allow these agencies to keep ALPR data from the public but could also allow the police to keep data and footage from other surveillance technologies—from body cameras to drones to face recognition—from ever being scrutinized.”

“Drivers would be surprised to learn that they are under investigation every time they drive in public,” said Peter Bibring, director of police practices at the ACLU SoCal. “The Fourth Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution exactly to prevent law enforcement from conducting mass, suspicionless investigations under ‘general warrants’ that target no specific person or place and never expire.”",2017-11-27T01:15:32.269834,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"EFF, ACLU Ask California Supreme Court to Order Release of Los Angeles License Plate Reader Data","The Fifth Column, Isiah Holmes",,[''],,"license plate, california, court, EFF, domestic spying, mass surveillance",,

Wilbur Ross, 79-year-old American investor specializing in distressed assets, has been named commerce secretary in Donald Trump's new administration. 
Ross was previously part of the Trump campaign's economic team (as senior advisor on trade) and contributed to Trump's 100-day action plan . 
The billionaire investor was one of Trump's early supporters and has known the president-elect for decades, famously helping Trump avoid bankruptcy in the 1980s.

1925,2694052.0,shadowproof.com,unknown,https://shadowproof.com/2012/05/30/uk-supreme-court-rejects-julian-assanges-extradition-appeal/,"(update below)

The Supreme Court in the United Kingdom issued a much anticipated decision today, ruling Sweden’s request for WikiLeaks founder and editor-in-chief Julian Assange’s extradition was “lawfully made.” By a majority of 5-to-2, the court found the Swedish public prosecutor in the case was in fact a “judicial authority” and held that the European arrest warrant (EAW) issued was valid.

Assange was not in court this morning. WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told Reuters, “This is not the final outcome. What we have here is retribution from the US.” He was granted the right to stay in the UK for two weeks while his lawyers consider applying to the Supreme Court to reopen the case. If the Supreme Court does not allow for the case to be re-opened, Assange could appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

According to The Guardian’s live coverage, Assange’s lawyers had argued in February the “Swedish system is unfair because it puts the power to issue arrest warrants in the hands of the same prosecutors who are trying to put the accused person in jail.” Dinah Rose, Assange’s QC, claimed “judicial authorities” meant a “judge or magistrate, and not a prosecutor, who is not independent.” The Supreme Court had deliberated over whether the Swedish prosecutor constituted a “judicial authority under the European arrest warrant framework and the Extradition Act of 2003, which incorporates it into British law, along with discussions of the history of the European arrest warrant framework going back to the 1957 European convention on extradition.”

Lord Phillips found the framework had been created to establish “a single uniform system for the surrender of those accused or convicted of the more serious criminal offenses” and the 11 member states that are party to the decision wanted to be able to have a judge or public prosecutor be a “judicial authority.”

Lord Mance, on the other hand, concluded in a dissenting opinion, “Whatever may be the meaning of the Framework Decision as a matter of European law, the intention of Parliament and the effect of the Extradition Act 2003 was to restrict the recognition by British courts of incoming European arrest warrants to those issued by a judicial authority in the strict sense of a court, judge or magistrate.”

The decision handed down was apparently decided under a point of law in the Vienna Convention on the Interpretation of Treaties, which was not argued by the prosecution or defense in the case. Assange’s lawyers or the Crown Prosecution Service, representing Swedish authorities, had also not been notified this would factor into the decision. (Full judgment available here.)

Highlighting the unlikelihood that the Supreme Court would reopen the case, legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg appeared on BBC News to describe this aspect of the decision:

It would be very embarrassing if the supreme court felt the need to reopen the case and it’s extraordinary, isn’t it, that they might have considered something which they gave the parties no opportunity to argue. From time to time judges do their research and they add points, minor points, that have not been considered, but it appears that the decisive point in this case was one that wasn’t argued, and that’s something which is pretty unusual, and that’s what prompted this unexpected intervention from Dinah Rose which took Lord Phillips so much by surprise that he mixed her up with the other counsel, Clare Montgomery.

It’s important to note that one key reason why Assange would want to vigorously fight the extradition involves the pre-trial restrictions and detention of which he might be subjected to in Sweden. Fair Trials International explains what will happen if extradited:

Mr Assange will be arrested on his arrival in Sweden and taken to a Swedish police station. Within 96 hours of being detained he will be brought to court, for a decision as to whether he should be remanded in custody until trial (see further below). This hearing is normally in private, unlike in many other countries, including the UK, where such hearings are normally in open court. As soon as the investigation is over, a decision will be taken about whether to formally charge him. Swedish law requires a person to be physically present before charges can be laid, so this can only happen once Mr Assange is on Swedish territory. Alternatively, prosecutors may decide not to charge Mr Assange and to release him.

Arrestees hardly ever get bail. The presumption is on detention so Assange is likely to not even enjoy the minimal freedom of house arrest, which he has been held under for over five hundred days. Like Pfc. Bradley Manning, the soldier accused of releasing classified information to WikiLeaks, he could be held in isolation:

Mr Assange could be held in isolation and barred from communicating with anyone other than his lawyers. He may be subjected to a range of restrictions such as: isolation: meaning that he is held in his cell for up to 23 hours a day;

no visits from anyone other than his lawyer or a priest;

restrictions on phone calls and written correspondence;

limited contact with other detainees; and

lack of access to newspapers, radio and television. There has been international criticism of these conditions. The Council of Europe has reported ongoing concerns about remand conditions in Sweden and that many people feel that they are prevented from contacting family members to ‘break’ them. The US State Department has also noted that people are often subject to extended isolation and severe restriction on their activities whilst awaiting trial.

Supporters of Assange are concerned about the fact that a bilateral treaty between the US and Sweden allows extradition without consent from the UK. They find it highly likely that once Assange gets to Sweden the United States will formally request extradition from Sweden.

A website called “Justice for Assange” highlights a statement by former legal adviser to the US State Department and National Security Council John B. Bellinger III, who stated, “The US government is certainly looking at the technical aspects of the two extradition agreements between the UK and Sweden and then considering the political and legal atmosphere in both places.”

While Assange’s extradition to the US is becoming more and more inevitable, options are still available. His lawyers can prepare to take the case to the ECHR while pushing the Supreme Court to reopen the case. However, as journalist and supporter John Pilger made clear last month the prospects may be grim:

…Thanks to a secret deal between the US and Sweden, he can be “rendered” to the American gulag at any time. In his own country, Australia, prime minister Julia Gillard has conspired with those in Washington she calls her “true mates” to ensure her innocent fellow citizen is fitted for his orange jump suit just in case he should make it home. In February, her government wrote a “WikiLeaks Amendment” to the extradition treaty between Australia and the US that makes it easier for her “mates” to get their hands on him. She has even given them the power of approval over Freedom of Information searches – so that the world outside can be lied to, as is customary…

Furthermore, if sent to the US, he would be in a country where a US soldier who allegedly released information to Assange’s media organization is accused of “aiding the enemy.” He would be subjected to the findings of a secret federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia. And he would face a political trial to convict him of espionage or treason against the US.

There is no reason to doubt that the US will stop at nothing to make an example out of Assange because of what he did by releasing information they did not want released because it contained details on corruption, misconduct and war crimes being committed or perpetrated by the United States. He caused a major hiccup in the daily operations of American empire. He helped foster an act that could have potentially destroyed authority and power wielded by the United States. And, for that, he is a political target whom the US needs to make an example to show what happens when one challenges US dominance in the world.

4065,6906079.0,thenewamerican.com,bias,https://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/18822-will-fed-pull-back-after-second-quarter-economic-growth,"The announcement July 30 that the U.S. economy grew at a four-percent annual rate for the second quarter of 2014 has financial analysts wondering if the Federal Reserve Bank will end earlier than expected the “quantitative easing” and interest rate suppression it has engaged in since 2008.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), “Real gross domestic product — the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States — increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent in the second quarter of 2014.... In the first quarter, real GDP decreased 2.1 percent (revised).” The numbers for the first quarter were better than previously announced, as the revised estimate replaced a 2.9 percent decrease in GDP.

The BEA noted that much of the growth can be attributed to a change in business inventory rather than actual market sales:

The change in real private inventories added 1.66 percentage points to the second-quarter change in real GDP after subtracting 1.16 percentage points from the first-quarter change. Private businesses increased inventories $$93.4 billion in the second quarter, following increases of $$35.2 billion in the first quarter and $$81.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

However, another part of the reason for economic “growth” was the increase in spending by the government sector, including state and local governments, with a 3.1-percent increase during the second quarter after several years of budget cuts.

The BEA also announced multi-year revisions to its economic growth projections, claiming that new analysis showed lower-than-announced growth had occurred in 2011 and 2012, but higher-than-announced growth had occurred in 2013. Reuters reported,

The government raised 2013 third-quarter growth to a 4.5 percent annual pace from the previous 4.1 percent. Growth for the fourth quarter of last year was lifted to a 3.5 percent annual rate from a previously reported 2.6 percent. Growth for 2013 was raised to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent.

The lackluster recovery — an average of just over two percent real GDP growth since 2010, as compared to more than four percent annually for seven years after the 1981-82 recession — is largely a result of a much lower national savings rate (about half of the 1982 level), and to a lesser extent higher government debt load (more than double the 1982 levels). But with the economy apparently heating up a little, the Wall Street Journal reported July 30,

Debate at the Fed is now turning to when to start raising interest rates. When last surveyed in June, most Fed officials said they expected to wait until 2015 and to move gradually once rate increases begin.

Federal Reserve Bank Open Market Committee officials — who have suppressed interest rates to zero since 2007 and have been creating money that is given to banks under the label “quantitative easing” (QE) since 2008 — had previously announced they will create progressively lower quantities of money each month, but have yet to announce an end date to new money creation.

The purchase of banks' financial assets (mortgages and student loans) on the open market by the Federal Reserve Bank with money created out of thin air is a direct transfer of wealth to the financial sector of the economy, in particular the largest banks and brokerage houses on Wall Street. Even at its current reduced rate of $$35 billion per month (it once stood at $$85 billion per month), QE is quite possibly the largest government corporate welfare scheme in human history.

For her part, Open Market Committee Chairman Janet Yellen has indicated that she doesn't believe the economy will heat up to four-percent annual GDP growth. “The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation,” Yellen said July 30 in a written statement on the Federal Reserve Bank's website, “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.”

That statement sounded to free market economists eerily like past economic prognostications of previous Fed chairmen. Yellen's predecessor Ben Bernanke told the media as late as July 2007 that “Overall, the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend.” Of course, by that time the “Great Recession” had already begun.

Many free market economists view the current economy as a bubble similar to the one of 2005-06, ready to pop once the Federal Reserve stops buying up mortgages and student loans in the open market under QE and lets interest rates rise.

EuroPacific Capital President Peter Schiff told Yahoo Finance July 30 that the high growth rate in the second quarter had to be balanced against the contraction in the first quarter:

The bad news is it's all downhill from here.... I think that it's obvious that the stimulus is wearing off, that the euphoric effects of all the cheap money — even though the cheap money is still here — the effects are wearing off.

Although Schiff added, “I think it's clear that the economy is rolling over,” he did not believe that Federal Reserve officials would do the right thing and let market forces take over.

Establishment financial analysts are less certain, and there's a fear of a new recession in an economy where the Federal Reserve cuts off of the economic “stimulus.” The London-based Financial Times warned July 30,

An outflow of deposits would be a reversal of a five-year trend that has seen significant amounts of extra cash poured into banks thanks to the Fed flooding the financial system with liquidity. These deposits, which act as a cheaper source of funding, have helped banks weather the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Now the worry is that such deposit funding may prove fleeting as the Fed retreats. Banks might have to pay higher rates on deposits to retain customers — potentially hitting their profits and sparking a price war for client funds.

The Federal Reserve's policy of suppressing interest rates has had a devastating impact on U.S. national savings rates — the largest factor in sustainable economic growth — by punishing savers with interest rates that often don't even equal the rate of inflation.

But despite “fears” of the corporate welfare gravy train ending on the part of Wall Street banking fat-cats, the Federal Reserve Bank has yet to announce a ""tapering"" of its $$35-billion-per-month transfer of money from the purchasing power of consumers to big banks.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

(Before It's News)

The mistreatment of black farm workers by Boer farmers is too much in South Africa. We hear that a 21-year-old has been thrown out of bakkie in North West, Man has been put in coffin alive, man has been thrown to lions and so many other stories.

I have worked in Farms and Game Reserve and I have first-hand experience of how some farmers treat their workers.

On the other hand, I have condemned farm murders and crime that target farmers.

But I think farm murders and targeted crime on Farmers is God’s judgement for farmer’s cruelty and mistreatment of black workers in South African farms.

At least treat the workers with humanity. Don’t beat workers, don’t deliberately withdraw their wages, don’t randomly shot people for no reason. That is humanity and justice.

There are some good farmers but those are few. Workers also don’t steal and deliberately destroy property.



The solution to racism is to defend what is right and condemn what is wrong. There is no race which is totally right or totally wrong.



Racial discrimination is a menace to any society. Racism by whites is evil. Racism by blacks is evil.

Don’t side with your race. Side with who is right and condemn what is unjust and defend peace. Love all.

Military sources told the official news agency, SANA, that the government troops took the hilltop of Bazo on the southern edge of Aleppo, near military bases, on Monday.

Sources said after the government forces captured Bazo, they shelled the nearby militant positions.

A video footage released by the Syrian army showed tanks and cannons pounding militants’ positions in the troubled area.

The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also confirmed that government troops have captured a strategic high ground in the militant-held parts of Aleppo.

SANA, meanwhile, said that militants shelled the areas under government control in Western Aleppo. The shelling killed at least one person and wounded seven others.

Clashes between Syrian government forces and militants erupted in the divided city of Aleppo after a unilateral ceasefire announced by Russia and the Syrian government came to an end.

The ceasefire expired on Saturday evening, after a one-day extension on Friday. The truce was aimed at permitting civilians and foreign-sponsored militants to leave the eastern areas of the city.

Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, has said that Russia is not considering any extension of a ceasefire in Syria’s northwestern city of Aleppo.

“The question of renewing the humanitarian pause is not relevant now,” Ryabkov told Interfax news agency, adding, “Over the last three days, what was needed did not happen.”

""In order to resume it, our opponents need to make sure the anti-government groups behave properly,"" the Russian diplomat said.

Aleppo has been divided between government forces in the west and the Takfiri terrorists in the east over the past few years.

The Syrian army has vowed to press ahead with its counter-terror operations and drive terrorists out of their major positions.

Chief among them is her ongoing role in the Star Wars franchise.

The eighth film in the series, in which Fisher appears as Leia Organa, wrapped shooting in July and is now in post-production. Sources tell Variety that Fisher's work on the sequel was finished. That means that Disney and LucasFilm, the producers of the Star Wars series, will not have to address Fisher's death until the ninth film begins shooting in 2018. Leia was originally slated to appear in that production.

Beyond Star Wars, Fisher was highly sought after for her on camera work and for her writing and script doctoring. Among her many projects, Fisher had a recurring role on the Amazon/Channel 4 comedy series ""Catastrophe,"" playing the caustic mother of star Rob Delaney's character. The show's third season is set to premiere early next year. Fisher was on a flight returning from her work on the show in London at the time she suffered a heart attack.

""Catastrophe"" has completed filming for its third season which will air in the spring. There's no word yet on how the show will handle Fisher's character in upcoming seasons. Co-creator and star Sharon Horgan said Tuesday on Instagram: ""She was the most generous, fun, gifted, smart, kind, funny funny funny person I've ever met. She certainly wasn't ready to go. I'm so glad we became pals. I'm so devastated at her loss. I want to write about her more but I can't process yet.""

Fisher was also supposed to film a role in the film ""Wonderwell,"" which IMDB writes is a fantastical story set in the world of fashion. Director Vlad Marsavin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of Fisher's work.

Fisher had a recurring role on Fox's ""Family Guy"" as the voice of Angela, the boss at the brewery where Seth MacFarlane's Peter Griffin works. She most recently appeared in an episode from last season that first aired Jan. 3. It's not clear if she had wrapped work on any additional episodes before her death.

A new documentary, ""Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,"" will screen at the upcoming Palm Springs Film Festival and air on HBO in March.

In the aftermath of Fisher's death this week, tributes flowed in from across the entertainment landscape. Co-stars such as Mark Hamill and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as Hollywood icons such as Steven Spielberg paid tribute to her sense of humor, her screen talent, and her legacy as a survivor of addiction and mental illness.

Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said it was difficult to imagine a world without Fisher, praising her as a barrier breaker.

""She was Princess Leia to the world but a very special friend to all of us,"" she said. ""She had an indomitable spirit, incredible wit, and a loving heart. Carrie also defined the female hero of our age over a generation ago. Her groundbreaking role as Princess Leia served as an inspiration of power and confidence for young girls everywhere.""",2017-11-27T01:15:02.476695,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,Carrie Fisher Completed Work on 'Star Wars: Episode VIII' Before Her Death,,,"['carrie', 'fisher', 'star', 'wars', 'completed', 'roles']",Carrie Fisher Completed Work on 'Star Wars: Episode VIII' Before Her Death,"Russia, Gun Rights, ISIS/Islamic State, Trump Administration, Donald Trump",,

25 January 2018 (The Washington Post) – Alexa, what time is the apocalypse? Ulp. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock a notch closer to the end of humanity Thursday, moving it ahead by 30 seconds after what the organization called a “grim assessment” of the state of geopolitical affairs. “As of today,” Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told reporters, “it is two minutes to midnight.” In moving the clock 30 seconds closer to the hour of the apocalypse, the group cited “the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change.” The organization — whose board includes 15 Nobel Laureates — now believes “the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II,” Bulletin officials Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert Rosner wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by The Washington Post. “In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels.” Krauss, a theoretical physicist, and Rosner, an astrophysicist, added: “To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States.” The clock, a metaphorical measure of humankind’s proximity to global catastrophe, also advanced 30 seconds last year, to 2½ minutes to “midnight” — the closest to the apocalyptic hour it has been since 1953, after the United States tested its first thermonuclear device, followed months later by the Soviet Union’s hydrogen bomb test. Before Thursday’s announcement, experts said there was only one direction the clock could possibly move, given recent events — including North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile test and the my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I think it would be very hard for the clock not​ to move forward,” Alex Wellerstein, who specializes in the history of nuclear weapons at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said in an email leading up to the announcement. “We have members of Congress, White House advisers, and even the president implying that they think war with a nuclear state is not only likely, but potentially desirable. That’s unusual and disturbing. “The question I have is: How much forward can they go?” Another 30 seconds, to be exact. [more]

The Doomsday Clock just moved: It’s now 2 minutes to ‘midnight,’ the symbolic hour of the apocalypse

By Lawrence Krauss and Robert Rosner

25 January 2018

(The Washington Post) – Days after Donald Trump took the oath of office, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reset the Doomsday Clock to 2½ minutes to midnight, in part because of destabilizing comments and threats from America’s new commander in chief. One year later, we are moving the clock forward again by 30 seconds, due to the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change. The Science and Security Board for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists assesses that the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II. In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels. To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States. The failure in 2017 to secure a temporary freeze on North Korea’s nuclear development was unsurprising to observers of the downward spiral of nuclear rhetoric between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But North Korea’s developing nuclear program will reverberate not just in the Asia-Pacific, as neighboring countries review their security options, but more widely, as all countries consider the costs and benefits of the international framework of nonproliferation treaties and agreements. Global nuclear risks were compounded by U.S.-Russia relations that now feature more conflict than cooperation. The United States and Russia remained at odds, continuing military exercises along the borders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undermining the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, upgrading their nuclear arsenals and eschewing arms control negotiations. Tensions over the South China Sea have increased. Pakistan and India have continued to build ever-larger arsenals of nuclear weapons. And in the Middle East, uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the landmark Iranian nuclear deal adds to a bleak overall picture. A related danger is the rise of cyberthreats targeting national infrastructure, including power grids, water supplies and military systems. On the climate-change front, the danger may seem less immediate than risk of nuclear annihilation, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now. Global carbon dioxide emissions have not yet shown the beginnings of the sustained decline toward zero that must occur if we are to avoid ever-greater warming. The nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse-gas emissions to manage even the climate risk accepted in the Paris accord. So far, the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge. The Trump administration’s decision essentially to turn a blind eye to climate change transpired against a backdrop of a worsening climate, including exceedingly powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean and other parts of North America and extreme heat waves in Australia, South America, Asia, Europe and California. The Arctic ice cap achieved its smallest-ever winter maximum in 2017. And last week, data from 2017 demonstrated a continued trend of exceptional global warmth. We believe that the perilous world security situation described here would, in itself, justify moving the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight. But there also is a real threat posed by a fundamental breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its long-standing leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or discern between sincere U.S. pronouncements and mere rhetoric. U.S. allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been force to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from an administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals and suffering from turnover in senior leadership. Led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, the administration has failed to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability. We hope this resetting of the clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant: an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now. It is time to rewind the Doomsday Clock.

We’re as close to Doomsday today as we were during the Cold War

WASHINGTON, D.C., 25 January 2018 (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists) – Citing growing nuclear risks and unchecked climate dangers, the iconic Doomsday Clock is now 30 seconds closer to midnight, the closest to the symbolic point of annihilation that the Clock has been since 1953 at the height of the Cold War. The decision announced today to move the Doomsday Clock to two minutes before midnight was made by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board in consultation with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 15 Nobel Laureates. The full text of the Doomsday Clock statement is available at http://www.thebulletin.org and includes key recommendations about how to #RewindtheDoomsdayClock.

Video from the Doomsday Clock announcement at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., is available at http://clock.thebulletin.org/ and on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/BulletinOfTheAtomicScientists/. The statement explaining the resetting of the time of the Doomsday Clock notes: “In 2017, world leaders failed to respond effectively to the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change, making the world security situation more dangerous than it was a year ago—and as dangerous as it has been since World War II. The greatest risks last year arose in the nuclear realm. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region, and the United States. Hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions on both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation …. On the climate change front, the danger may seem less immediate, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now …. The nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse gas emissions to keep climate risks manageable, and so far, the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge.” Fueling concerns about the potential of a nuclear holocaust are a range of U.S.-Russian military entanglements, South China Sea tensions, escalating rhetoric between Pakistan and India, and uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the Iran nuclear deal. Contributing to the risks of nuclear and non-nuclear clashes around the globe are the rise of nation-state information technology and internet-based campaigns attacking infrastructure and free elections, according to the statement. Also highlighted as an overarching global concern: The decline of U.S. leadership and a related demise of diplomacy under the Trump Administration. “… [T]here has also been a breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its longstanding leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or understand when U.S. pronouncements are real, and when they are mere rhetoric. International diplomacy has been reduced to name-calling, giving it a surrealistic sense of unreality that makes the world security situation ever more threatening.” In January 2017, the Doomsday Clock’s minute hand edged forward by 30 seconds, to two and half minutes before midnight. For the first time, the Doomsday Clock was influenced by statements from an incoming U.S. President, Donald Trump, regarding the proliferation and the prospect of actually using nuclear weapons, as well as statements made in opposition to U.S. commitments regarding climate change. Rachel Bronson, president and CEO, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said: “Because of the extraordinary danger of the current moment, the Science and Security Board today moves the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock 30 seconds closer to catastrophe. It is now two minutes to midnight­­­­—the closest the Clock has ever been to Doomsday, and as close as it was in 1953, at the height of the Cold War.” Lawrence Krauss, director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University, Foundation Professor at School of Earth and Space Exploration and Physics Department, Arizona State University, and chair, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Board of Sponsors, said: “The current, extremely dangerous state of world affairs need not be permanent. The means for managing dangerous technology and reducing global-scale risk exist; indeed, many of them are well-known and within society’s reach, if leaders pay reasonable attention to preserving the long-term prospects of humanity, and if citizens demand that they do so. This is a dangerous time, but the danger is of our own making. Humankind has invented the implements of apocalypse; so can it invent the methods of controlling and eventually eliminating them. This year, leaders and citizens of the world can move the Doomsday Clock and the world away from the metaphorical midnight of global catastrophe by taking common-sense action.” Robert Rosner, William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Physics at the University of Chicago, and chair, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “We hope this resetting of the Clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant—as an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now: #RewindtheDoomsdayClock.” Sharon Squassoni, research professor of practice at the Institute for International Science and Technology Policy, Elliott School of International Affairs, The George Washington University, and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “In the past year, U.S. allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been forced to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from a U.S. administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals, suffering from turnover in senior leadership, led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, and unable to develop, coordinate, and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management, and global stability. It has made the existing nuclear risks greater than necessary and added to their complexity.” Sivan Kartha, senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute and co-leader of SEI’s Gender and Social Equity Program, and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “2017 just clocked in as the hottest year on record that wasn’t boosted by an El Nino. And that matches what we’ve witnessed on the ground: the Caribbean suffered a season of historic damage from exceedingly powerful hurricanes, extreme heat waves struck across the globe, the Arctic ice cap hit its lowest winter peak on record, and the U.S. suffered devastating wildfires. And while this was happening, the Trump administration dutifully carried through on the campaign promise of derailing U.S. climate policy, putting avowed climate denialists in top cabinet positions, and announcing plans to withdraw from the Paris climate Agreement. Thankfully, this didn’t cause global cooperation to unravel, and other countries have reaffirmed their commitment to take action against climate change.” #RewindtheDoomsdayClock is a major message of the 2018 statement, with the following action steps among those recommended: U.S. President Donald Trump should refrain from provocative rhetoric regarding North Korea, recognizing the impossibility of predicting North Korean reactions. The U.S. and North Korean governments should open multiple channels of communication.

The world community should pursue, as a short-term goal, the cessation of North Korea’s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests. North Korea is the only country to violate the norm against nuclear testing in 20 years.

The Trump administration should abide by the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear program unless credible evidence emerges that Iran is not complying with the agreement or Iran agrees to an alternative approach that meets U.S. national security needs.

The United States and Russia should discuss and adopt measures to prevent peacetime military incidents along the borders of NATO.

U.S. and Russian leaders should return to the negotiating table to resolve differences over the INF treaty, to seek further reductions in nuclear arms, to discuss a lowering of the alert status of the nuclear arsenals of both countries, to limit nuclear modernization programs that threaten to create a new nuclear arms race, and to ensure that new tactical or low-yield nuclear weapons are not built, and existing tactical weapons are never used on the battlefield.

U.S. citizens should demand, in all legal ways, climate action from their government. Climate change is a real and serious threat to humanity.

Governments around the world should redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so they go well beyond the initial, inadequate pledges under the Paris Agreement.

The international community should establish new protocols to discourage and penalize the misuse of information technology to undermine public trust in political institutions, in the media, in science, and in the existence of objective reality itself.

5185,5902375.0,theduran.com,unreliable,http://theduran.com/russia-wins-judgment-against-ukraine-in-london-high-court/,"The High Court in London this morning granted Russia’s request for an expedited hearing (ie. summary Judgment) of its claim against Ukraine arising from Ukraine’s non-payment of the $$3 billion loan Ukraine owes Russia.

This is not the final Judgment in the case. That is however probably no more than a few weeks away. Reports say the High Court rejected all of Ukraine’s arguments that it should not be required to pay the loan for political reasons, and this together with the High Court’s decision to grant Russia an expedited hearing makes it now a virtual certainty that the High Court will shortly decide the case in Russia’s favour, and declare Ukraine in default on its loan.

As those who have followed my writings on this question will know, this is what I have argued was likely to happen from the start. Indeed on strict legal principles it is difficult to see what other possible Judgment the High Court could have made.

Ukraine is saying it will appeal today’s Judgment, presumably to the Court of Appeal and, if it loses there, presumably ultimately to the British Supreme Court. In English law an appeal does not however automatically delay implementation of a Judgment, and since today’s decision is procedural I cannot see what grounds for appeal there are, and I expect Ukraine’s appeal to be refused.

This means that a final Judgment in the case may now be no more than weeks away.

The big question therefore is what will happen when the High Court finally decides the case in Russia’s favour, and finds Ukraine in default of its $$3 billion loan to Russia, as it is now almost certain to do.

Will the IMF recognise that this is a legal declaration from the world’s most powerful commercial court that Ukraine is in default to Russia, which since Russia is a member of the Paris Club should mean that any further IMF lending to Ukraine must cease according to the IMF’s own rules? Or will the IMF find some way to ignore its rules so that it can continue lending to Ukraine despite the High Court in London declaring Ukraine in default?

My guess is the former, and my guess also is that it was the pending decision made today by the High Court in London rather than Ukraine’s transport blockade of the Donbass which caused the IMF Board on 20th March 2017 to postpone its decision on further lending to Ukraine. See my full discussion here.

The political implications – and the potential economic consequences for Ukraine – of the country being declared in default and being cut off from all external funding, including IMF funding, are however immense, and Western governments which have invested so heavily in supporting Ukraine will be increasingly anxious.

POSTSCRIPT: Since writing the above the High Court in London has published the High Court’s Judgment granting Russia summary Judgment in the case of Ukraine’s $$3 billion Eurobond. The full Judgment, together with an executive summary, can be found here.

It is clear from the Judgment that the judge – Mr. Justice Blair, who is incidentally former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s brother – gave consideration to every part of Ukraine’s Defence. As I expected he also accepted without qualification Ukraine’s claims about Crimea’s “annexation by Russia” and about “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine”. However in the end – as I predicted – he had no hesitation deciding that these “defences” are non-justiciable (ie. they lie outside the jurisdiction of the High Court) and decided the case in Russia’s favour. The words, which best summarise the whole Judgment are arguable these at the very end of the full Judgment

……ultimately, this is a claim for repayment of debt instruments to which the court has held that there is no justiciable defence. It would not be right to order the case to go forward to a full trial in such circumstances.

Though the Judge’s discussion is very detailed and makes many references to case law, those familiar with my previous discussion of the case should be able to follow it.

It is clear from the Judgment that Russia has in fact been granted Summary Judgment. In other words the High Court has decided the case in Russia’s favour and against Ukraine. There are some technical issues still left to be decided but essentially, unless Ukraine succeeds in getting the Judgment set aside on appeal (which I think is extremely unlikely) the case is over, Ukraine has lost, and Russia has won.

The one thing the Judge did do for Ukraine is grant Ukraine a 1 month’s stay of execution of the Judgment. Presumably this is to allow Ukraine time to appeal and in order for the Court to deal with the remaining issues (eg. decide the exact amount Ukraine owes and the legal costs it must pay). These will apparently be decided in late April, at which point unless an appeal is granted Ukraine will formally be in default.

The ball has now been passed to the IMF. It now has a difficult decision to make, deciding what it must now do. On balance I expect it to accept that Ukraine is in default to a member of the Paris Club and to stop lending to Ukraine. As I have said previously, the legal implications of the IMF not doing so are awesome, and despite the political pressures I suspect there will be too many people in the IMF bureaucracy who counsel against it for it in the end to happen.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Israelis and Palestinians have always been on the cusp of all-out war, but now that Trump has declared Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, it appears that both sides are ready to finally pull the trigger, both figuratively and very, very literally.

The Times of Israel reported that a joint poll published by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research (TSC), Tel Aviv University and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah showed that Palestinians and Israel are more in favor of going to war with one another than ever before, now consisting of the majority of the population.

According to the poll, support for war has almost doubled among the Palestinians, while military solutions among Israelis skyrocketed by almost 60 percent.

What’s more, The Times of Israel reports that those open to seeking peaceful solutions are down dramatically:

When asked what should happen next, just 26% percent of Palestinians chose the option of a peace deal, a staggering decline from 45% last June. Thirty-eight percent supported armed struggle, up from just 21% in the previous survey. A similar but less extreme trend was seen among Israeli Jews. Thirty-eight percent said a peace deal should be sought, down from 45% six months ago, and the percentage of supporters for a “decisive military offensive” to end the conflict increased from 12% to 19%.

All experts point to Trump’s Jerusalem declaration as the reason calls for violence have risen.

Calls for violence among Palestinian groups is nothing new, however. Terrorist organizations have been calling for violence since Trump made the Jerusalem declaration, including the leader of Hamas, who said he wanted to make Trump regret his decision.

Dan Patrick said Friday his state would give up all federal education funding in order to avoid complying with the gender equity law Title IX in how trans students are treated. www.huffingtonpost.com/...

What is Title IX

1. Title IX is a landmark federal civil right that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Title IX is not just about sports; it is a prohibition against sex-based discrimination in education. It addresses discrimination against pregnant and parenting students and women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs. It also addresses sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, and sexual violence. Sexual violence includes attempted or completed rape or sexual assault, as well as sexual harassment, stalking, voyeurism, exhibitionism, verbal or physical sexuality-based threats or abuse, and intimate partner violence. 2. Title IX does not apply to female students only. Title IX protects any person from sex-based discrimination, regardless of their real or perceived sex, gender identity, and/or gender expression. Female, male, and gender non-conforming students, faculty, and staff are protected from any sex-based discrimination, harassment or violence. 3. Your school must be proactive in ensuring that your campus is free of sex discrimination. You are protected under Title IX even if you do not experience sex discrimination directly. Schools must take immediate steps to address any sex discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence on campus to prevent it from affecting students further. If a school knows or reasonably should know about discrimination, harassment or violence that is creating a “hostile environment” for any student, it must act to eliminate it, remedy the harm caused and prevent its recurrence. knowyourix.org/...

So if All Texas College Football Teams are not letting Transgender students go to the bathroom of their own choice then can a college in compliance with title IX allow a home football game with a non Title IX compliant Texas Team and expect to keep their Federal Funding? Colleges must prevent ANY sex discrimination on campus even if its from the other team’s football team.

Given how popular football is in Texas imagine how many parents will be angry that their son’s Texas college football scholarship will not let their son’s play football against other state colleges theirby drastically effecting their son’s chances of making it to a Pro Football Team?

Next imagine how many Texas football coaches will get angry that their best players are suddenly all taking offers to play football in out of state colleges because they want better odds of playing play pro ball?

How many colleges that make money off of their college football teams ( there are not that many but some ) will be looking at years to rebuild their championship college teams from scratch?

All it will take to get Texas to comply is for just a little more pressure to be applied and if that pressure is applied now this will help the Dems will the election. Showing strength wins Conservative votes not ideas and either Texas backs down before the election ( which helps us win the election ) or the fall Texas football season will be very disappointing.

Given Trump is expected to lose no matter who he runs against Texas Parents and Colleges will then have 4 years to change Texas Blue or at the very least change Texas’s bathroom policy. The Texas GOP needs this issue to go away now and quietly before the election assuming that the White House has the Stones to go forward and avoid compromise.",2017-11-27T01:14:21.395055,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,Did Texas just threaten to quit college football?,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

US Defense Secretary Robert Gates left for Asia this week to attend an annual security conference in Singapore to be held on Friday through Saturday at the level of regional defense ministers.

US Defense Secretary Robert Gates left for Asia this week to attend an annual security conference in Singapore to be held on Friday through Saturday at the level of regional defense ministers.

The annual security conference in Singapore, called the Shangri-la Dialogue, which gets its name from the Shangri-la Hotel in the city where the meeting is held, will bring top officials and experts from across the Asia-Pacific region.

In past years the events have been dominated by US concerns over China’s perceived military buildup. But this year, the death toll of tens of thousands of people in an earthquake in China and a cyclone in Myanmar are likely to highlight the need for greater regional cooperation.

While US doubts about China’s intentions have not diminished, the US Secretary of Defense has largely taken a more congenial approach toward Beijing than his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, who was viewed in the region as a hawk. Gates, for example, recently cautioned the US military against what he called “next-war-it is”, arguing that it is more likely to face irregular conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan than conventional wars with other “near peer” states like China or Russia.

But at the same time, the Pentagon chief has encouraged the US military to strengthen defense ties with regional powers like India and Indonesia as a hedge against China. Overall, US administration officials need to do an intricate balancing act on this matter. They need to be clear that Washington is conscious of perceived China’s military threat. But at the same time they need to avoid provoking a confrontation with China at a time when the US is tied up in Iraq and Afghanistan and China is trying to cope with the aftermath of its devastating earthquake.

Yet, senior US military officials have stressed repeatedly over the past year that China has not done enough to put to rest US concerns about its military modernization. An annual Pentagon report to Congress said China is developing the means to project military power and deny the US military access to the region, particularly in a putative conflict with Taiwan.

But according to Michael Green, who served as Asian affairs director at the National Security Council in the Bush administration until 2005, “the overall strategic picture with China is very mixed, as it is with a lot of countries – enormous economic interdependence but a level of strategic mistrust that won’t go away”. And yet there have been some positive developments in the region as well. Chinese President Hu Jintao met the head of Taiwan’s ruling party in Beijing this week in the highest-level contact since the two sides split in 1949. This historic meeting representing the two arch-enemies is widely viewed in the world as part of a dramatic easing of tensions between the two sides that is likely to see them resume a formal dialogue that has been suspended for over a decade.",2017-11-27T01:15:17.147615,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,Radio : Tid-Bits of the Week,Yuri Reshetnikov,,['GATES HEADS TO ASIA TO SHORE UP US POSITIONS'],US Defense Secretary Robert Gates left for Asia this week to attend an annual security conference in Singapore to be held on Friday through Saturday at the level of regional defense ministers.,,,

Syria has been in a state of civil war since 2011. Forces loyal to President Bashar Assad are fighting multiple opposition groups as well as radical Islamist militant organizations, including the Nusra Front and Islamic State.

Moscow has been involved in international efforts to resolve the ongoing civil war in Syria, hosting two rounds of negotiation talks between the government and the opposition in 2015. Russia is also conducting an anti-terrorist aerial campaign in Syria, with airstrikes on extremist positions since late Sepember at Assad’s request.

On October 30, top diplomats from the United States, Russia, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Lebanon and France, as well as UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, met in Vienna to discuss an end to the four-year Syrian civil war.

4664,9543880.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/business/in-japan-a-test-of-inflation-targets.html,"This week the Liberal Democratic Party, which had ruled Japan for nearly its entire postwar history until it was swept from power three years ago, won a landslide victory. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister from 2006 to 2007, will get another chance.

Mr. Abe devoted a decent part of his campaign to criticism of the Bank of Japan, the country’s central bank. He wants the bank to pursue inflation, and to effectively print money until it gets it. At one point during the campaign he spoke of a 3 percent inflation target, although he seems to have cut that back to 2 percent.

Either goal, if realized, would be a major change for the country. The inflation index used in calculations of gross domestic product is now 18 percent lower than it was at the end of 1994.

On Thursday, the central bank took a relatively small step in the direction favored by Mr. Abe. It decided to step up its asset purchases and seemed to leave open the possibility that it would adopt the inflation target at a later meeting. Mr. Abe praised the move.

To a significant extent, deflationary expectations are now baked into the Japanese economy. Tiny government bond yields have persisted for many years. Even though the nominal yields are small, the real (after inflation) yields have been respectable because there has been deflation, not inflation. And the competition has not been that great. The stock market has fluctuated, but it remains far below where it was when the Japanese bubble began to deflate in the early 1990s. Real estate losses from that bubble — do you remember when the gardens of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were supposed to be worth more than the entire state of California? — still have an impact on investor psychology.

Western economists, Mr. Bernanke among them, have long called for Japan to target inflation. Lately, some Chinese economists have been offering similar lectures. But until now, little has happened. The central bank has announced a goal of positive inflation of up to 1 percent, but it is not widely believed, and it has certainly not happened.

As it is, the limited quantitative easing efforts of the Japanese central bank have been viewed as temporary, and as not really changing anything. Whether the new promises of something more significant will be credible remains to be seen.

“At this point, moving to a 2 percent target would not be such a giant step,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has suggested inflation targeting in the United States as well as in Japan. “They have to pursue it vigorously until we have inflation expectations firmly higher. No one knows how much they would have to do to accomplish that.”

The Bank of Japan has in the past been hesitant to really try to establish that credibility, for at least two reasons. One is that there is fear that the Japanese government bond market would be disrupted. Another is that it could do severe damage to the central bank’s own balance sheet. It owns a lot of Japanese government bonds whose market value would fall. Conceivably, that could cause the bank to seek a recapitalization from the government, something that would be embarrassing, to say the least.

To establish the credibility, the central bank would have to show a readiness to create credit at a rapid rate. It would probably also need to take steps to hold down the value of the yen, a move that would no doubt cause concern in the United States.

It is, however, very doable, as Switzerland has shown. When the euro zone debt crisis was at its worst, Switzerland became a safe haven for European investors worried that the euro might blow up. That drove up the value of the Swiss franc versus the euro and damaged Switzerland’s ability to compete. The Swiss government responded by announcing that the euro would not be allowed to fall below 1.2 Swiss francs. If necessary, the government would simply sell francs to meet any demand.

That has been necessary, and the Swiss have accumulated a huge portfolio of foreign currency. So, too, could the Japanese if they chose to announce that the dollar would henceforth be worth at least 100 yen, a level not seen since 2009.

Doing so would instantly restore at least some competitiveness to Japanese industry, which has experienced something that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago: Japan has a trade deficit.

Bringing inflation to Japan could make the country’s debt load — now higher than that of any other major country — appear more manageable. One unfortunate result of deflation coupled with perennial recession is that a country’s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio rises even if no more money is borrowed. Measured in yen, the Japanese economy was larger when Mr. Abe left office in 2007 — two years before his party lost power — than it is now.

A stronger recovery in the United States, not to mention avoiding a new Europe-wide downturn, would make it easier for Japan to begin to grow again. But even if that did happen, it would not solve all of Japan’s problems. The country has an aging, shrinking population. It needs more workers, but the Japanese attitude toward immigration makes Arizona look liberal by comparison.

Japan’s economy has been adrift for so long that much of the world takes for granted that it cannot, or at least will not, ever be reformed. Such cynicism has a basis, but it is possible that circumstances have changed. Japanese who seemed content with the way things were now clearly want something different, even if they are not sure what, or how to get it.

Three years ago, the Democratic Party of Japan won a landslide election, only to prove stumbling and incoherent when it tried to govern. Now the voters have turned back to the Liberal Democrats. Whether Mr. Abe will be more competent, and whether he will be able to effectively lead a party that still has competing factions, is far from clear.

Even though essential oils have been around for so long, it is only recently that the products have become super popular commercial items thanks to marketing initiatives that target interested consumers. It is almost like people did not read the small print on these bottles and make the connection that maybe the oils are harmful to pets like cats who have much weaker constitutions.

We can’t blame people for being into essential oils. Essential oils are usually naturally-derived and offer a potential cure for stress and other potential challenges. The current crop of companies on Facebook selling essential oils are making some claims that really have no basis in fact. Claims that essential oils can help you lose weight or keep your house clean are convincing a lot of people to invest in these products without realizing that it is personal drive and work ethic that will actually help them lose weight and keep a tidy house.

Two of the biggest companies are Young Living Essential Oils and DoTerra, which has recruited over 3 million sellers since it’s launch on 2008.

In any event, customers are taking to Facebook to offer their concerns after a Mom posted about how she accidentally poisoned her cat with an essential oil spray.

Sue Murray, who lives in Michigan, posted that her daughter’s cat Ernie did not take well to the spray. She was using a Eucalyptus spray she bought on Amazon in her bedroom because she read somewhere that it helped with congestion. All it seems to have done is make 16-year old Ernie feel sick.

“The first couple days I didn’t notice any symptoms with Ernie, but on the fourth day, he was lethargic, unstable on his feet and he was drooling excessively.”

It was only then that her husband looked up eucalyptus and realized it can be fatal for cats. They rushed Ernie to the vet and made sure he got the attention he needed.

“The vet gave him a shot of antibiotics and another shot of vitamins to boost him and instructions to watch him over the weekend,” according to Sue. She went on to add that “Ernie has not been himself. He is eating and drinking a little, walking a little better, has some diarrhea, but is still not out of the woods.”

Of course, it goes without saying that Sue was not informed of these risks by the company she bought from. Her post has been shared over 700,000 times and points to a general concern amongst consumers that information is lacking in the essential oils they buy.

The reaction from companies has been just as swift as the complaints brought about after Sue’s post. Many of these companies claim their products are safe to use around pets, and that it is really a rare case for an essential oil to harmful. One of the bigger companies, DoTerra, even went so far as accusing Sue of buying cheap oils!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"If You Use Essential Oils And Own A Cat, There’s A Deadly Warning You Need To Hear",Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,

Christina says she was even punched in the stomach as the party was shut down. The guest was struck off the site and police launched an investigation into Christina’s assault.

A search of Fatima’s cellphone records shows that while she was being interviewed by investigators hours after the attack, someone sent the teen a text message that read, “The detective will find out tell them (can’t) talk,” the affidavit states. Fatima and her mother were the only ones at their El Cajon home on Skyview Street when the attack occurred about 11 a.m. on March 21. Alawadi’s husband, Kassim Alhimidi, had reportedly left to take the couple’s other younger children to school, although police state in the March 27 affidavit that his whereabouts had not yet been confirmed. Fatima told El Cajon police that she heard her mother squeal, and 10 seconds later heard the sound of glass breaking, the affidavit said. She told police she thought her mother had dropped a plate. Ten minutes later, the daughter discovered her mother lying unconscious on the ground, near a computer, and called 911.

She heard her mother squeal? Before we heard that she slept through the whole thing.

A neighbor reported seeing a skinny dark-skinned male running west from the area of Alawadi’s house. He was described as being in his late teens to early 20s, 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, wearing a dark blue or black hooded sweatshirt and carrying a brown doughnut-shaped cardboard box. Alawadi died at a hospital three days later. An autopsy noted the assault was “extremely violent” and showed Alawadi had at least six hits to the head, with at least four skull fractures. The injuries were possibly caused by an object similar to a tire iron, with a striking edge that is narrow and made of a hard material, according to the records. The sheriff’s crime lab determined a threatening handwritten note found near the victim was a copy, not the original, the records state. Authorities have not made public the contents of the note, but Fatima and other family members have told reporters that it ordered the family to go back where they came from. Police have said that the note indicates the possibility of a hate crime but have stressed they are exploring all possibilities. The family told police a similar note was left at their home in the weeks before the attack, but the family did not keep the note or report it to police at the time. The possibility of a hate crime has reverberated around the world, especially in the Muslim community, and prompted supporters to hold candlelight vigils and demonstrations denouncing bigotry….

Apologies awaited. Neither Pamela Geller nor I have ever condoned or advocated violence, or anything but legal action in defense of human rights. These Islamic supremacist groups and their Leftist allies are avid to destroy our reputations and find a “hate crime” they can connect us with, so as to silence the truths we tell.

During a search of the home and the couple’s vehicles in the hours after the attack, police found court paperwork to file for divorce in Alawadi’s Ford Explorer. The packet was not filled out, but a form requesting a court fee waiver was filled out in handwriting with Alawadi’s name, address and phone number…. Police also searched computers, cellphones and other devices. Among the evidence they were searching for was an earring matching a bloody one found near Alawadi. Family told investigators that she usually wore four earrings, according to the records. Detectives were also seeking any other notes, a weapon similar to a tire iron and any forensic evidence. Investigators also learned of a previous police contact with Fatima. On Nov. 3, police found Fatima with a 21-year-old man after responding to a report of two people possibly having sex in a car, the documents state. Officers called her mother, who came to the location and picked up the girl. As they were driving away, Fatima said, “I love you, mom,” before jumping out of the vehicle onto Mollison Avenue at 35 mph. She was taken to a hospital with several injuries, including a possible broken arm. She refused to talk to police at the hospital but reportedly told paramedics and hospital staff that she was being forced to marry her cousin and didn’t want to. Rawnaq Yacub, the man in the incident, told U-T San Diego Wednesday that police interviewed him after the slaying and some of his clothes were taken from the home he shares with his family. He said he has no connection to the crime. He described Fatima as a “best friend” and said there is no romantic relationship. He and Fatima were only talking in the car when police contacted them five months ago, he said. Fatima, her father and a brother flew to Iraq last week for Alawadi’s funeral on Saturday and planned to stay for two weeks, a family friend said. Alawadi’s father is a Shia cleric in Iraq.

Vanessa Vine, who has campaigned against Cuadrilla’s drilling in Balcombe, a village south of London, said the shale gas industry was “ecocidal.”

“Shame on you!” Ms. Vine said to Mr. Browne.

A man who identified himself as Clive Humphries called Mr. Browne a “criminal” before storming out.

In an email, Mr. Browne said the “lively debate” showed companies needed to “dispel myths about the hydraulic fracturing process” and “engage deeply with local communities.” He added, “ I have never seen any hydrocarbon resource developed without some sort of opposition.”

Out in the field, operators have encountered a combination of protest and legal maneuvering. Last summer, protestors in Balcombe used a makeshift camp as a base to demonstrate against Cuadrilla’s drilling, while local residents, advised by the larger environmental groups, created legal and regulatory obstacles for the company.

Cuadrilla’s permit has run out at Balcombe, but activists have set up a camp, complete with a wind turbine for electricity, outside a site in Barton, near Manchester, where another company called IGas Energy is preparing to drill.

On Sunday, protesters tried to dislodge the gates to the site, but the company reinforced them with an earth-moving machine, said Rachel Thompson, a local resident affiliated with a protest group called Frack Off.

“This is going to grow and grow. Everywhere they take the rigs, we will take the camp,” she said.

Oil and gas executives have long said that shale gas would be a tough sell in densely populated Western Europe, but the industry is also meeting resistance in Eastern Europe, where companies thought the going would be easier partly because of a desire there to ease their dependence on gas from Russia.

Beginning last month, protests in a farming area called Pungesti in northeastern Romania have delayed preparations by Chevron, the American energy company, to drill there.

On Dec. 2, police officers in black uniforms cleared away protesters. But trouble flared again on Saturday. Video provided by Chevron shows young men flattening a security fence and tossing rocks onto the site.

Maria Olteanu, an activist in Bucharest, the capital, who acts as a liaison with people in Pungesti, says the villagers there are “fighting for their lives. They are sure there will be water and soil contamination. Animals will die,” as a result of fracking, she said.

She also said people in remote areas are now knowledgeable about the well-publicized problems like water pollution that opponents say fracking has caused in the United States.

“We are very well-connected with a European network and international network,” she said.

Although the situation varies from country to country, fracking’s opponents are scoring successes. In countries like Germany and France, fracking is forbidden. Even in Britain, where the national government favors shale gas exploitation, it has been more than two years since a company fracked a shale gas well.

In Eastern Europe, national governments like those in Romania, Poland and Ukraine have given their assent, but some people in local communities have yet to be won over. There has even been resistance in Poland, although a poll last summer showed strong overall support for shale gas production. In the village of Zurawlow in southeast Poland, near the Ukrainian border, farmers have blocked access to a Chevron test site with farm equipment for several months.

Tomasz Szpryngier, an investor in tourism projects whose family owns farmland in the area, said by telephone “if this area starts to be an exploitation area, it will be like putting money in a ditch.”

Although Chevron says the protesters have not had a “significant impact” on its operations, the company has filed a civil action against them for “violating Chevron’s rights to access its property and conduct scheduled works.”

David L. Goldwyn, a former senior energy official at the U.S. Department of State, who has run workshops on shale gas for regulators, lawmakers and academics in eastern Europe with Chevron sponsorship, says companies are finding themselves in a difficult situation.

“While they are still negotiating for licenses, the NGOs spin up local opposition,” he said, referring to nongovernmental organizations. “Before they have boots on the ground, protests are underway.”

Mr. Goldwyn thinks that if shale gas exploitation is to win acceptance, governments “are going to have to be a little more creative about how they are going to share the income.”

Which part of “well-regulated” is ambiguous or hard to understand?

Apparently even Supreme Court Judge Scalia understands what the words “well-regulated” mean -- as he spelled out, back in 2008.



District of Columbia v. Heller - 07-290 (2008) -- supreme.justia.com



[...] 1.(f) [...] United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. Pp. 47–54. 2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited . It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms .

[...]

1) limits the type of weapon; 2) concealed weapons prohibitions; 3) prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill; 4) forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings; 5) laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms;

In those two Scalia-authored paragraphs, the Strict-Constructionist-Conservative outlined several ""legal exceptions"" where gun ownership[Shorter: Bazooka Bans; Licensing; Competence; Locality; Gun-sale Registration & Supplier constraints.]

That is what ""well-regulated"" means to Conservative-icon Antonin Scalia.



Right are granted us. But those right are NOT Absolute.

My right to free speech ends, where your nose begins.

And your right to own the weapons of war ends, where the safety of the public begins.



The public does still possess its inalienable right to ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.""

And so your right to own the weapons of war ends, where the public's right to ""Life and Liberty and the Pursuit"" begins. Victims of gun violence find it kind of hard to pursue those ... by the way.



Some rights maybe ""un-infringable,"" but those same rights have ALSO been ruled to very ""well-regulatable"" too.

Just ask Antonin, what ""well-regulated"" means to him. Or just read how he ruled on those Limits to Gun Rights, when the case was before him -- for him to make un-infringablly, unambiguously clear.

People in these societies tend to overvalue their own skills and overestimate their own importance to any group effort. People in collective societies tend to value harmony and duty. They tend to underestimate their own skills and are more self-effacing when describing their contributions to group efforts.

Researchers argue about why certain cultures have become more individualistic than others. Some say that Western cultures draw their values from ancient Greece , with its emphasis on individual heroism, while other cultures draw on more on tribal philosophies. Recently, some scientists have theorized that it all goes back to microbes. Collectivist societies tend to pop up in parts of the world, especially around the equator, with plenty of disease-causing microbes. In such an environment, you’d want to shun outsiders, who might bring strange diseases, and enforce a certain conformity over eating rituals and social behavior.

Either way, individualistic societies have tended to do better economically. We in the West have a narrative that involves the development of individual reason and conscience during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and then the subsequent flourishing of capitalism. According to this narrative, societies get more individualistic as they develop.

But what happens if collectivist societies snap out of their economic stagnation? What happens if collectivist societies, especially those in Asia , rise economically and come to rival the West? A new sort of global conversation develops.

The opening ceremony in Beijing was a statement in that conversation. It was part of China’s assertion that development doesn’t come only through Western, liberal means, but also through Eastern and collective ones.

The ceremony drew from China’s long history, but surely the most striking features were the images of thousands of Chinese moving as one — drumming as one, dancing as one, sprinting on precise formations without ever stumbling or colliding. We’ve seen displays of mass conformity before, but this was collectivism of the present — a high-tech vision of the harmonious society performed in the context of China’s miraculous growth.

If Asia’s success reopens the debate between individualism and collectivism (which seemed closed after the cold war), then it’s unlikely that the forces of individualism will sweep the field or even gain an edge.

For one thing, there are relatively few individualistic societies on earth. For another, the essence of a lot of the latest scientific research is that the Western idea of individual choice is an illusion and the Chinese are right to put first emphasis on social contexts.

Scientists have delighted to show that so-called rational choice is shaped by a whole range of subconscious influences, like emotional contagions and priming effects (people who think of a professor before taking a test do better than people who think of a criminal). Meanwhile, human brains turn out to be extremely permeable (they naturally mimic the neural firings of people around them). Relationships are the key to happiness. People who live in the densest social networks tend to flourish, while people who live with few social bonds are much more prone to depression and suicide .

It stands to reason, therefore, conservatives and liberals must differ in many ways, including biological, homo sapiens being biological animals. As an example, studies have found that people are more attracted to the smell of those whose immune systems are compatible with their own.

Research has found that political attitudes, rooted as they are in personality and basic beliefs, also have a biological component. Conservatives, for example, have stronger disgust reactions than liberals, and some early brain-scan data hints that the two groups process risk and fear differently.

The latest discovery: Conservatives and liberals actually smell different!

A recent experiment found that conservatives like the smell of other conservatives, while liberals find the smell of conservatives repugnant.

Stephanie Pappas reports for Live Science, Sept. 22, 2014, that a new study finds that people prefer the scents of those who share their political attitudes. This small, subconscious preference could explain why people gravitate toward mates whose politics mesh with theirs — perhaps compatibility has a smell.

In fact, Mr. Christie vetoed a gun bill in August that had been supported by the judiciary and many law enforcement officials, and unanimously passed in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature. It would add an extra check when people with a history of mental illness seek legal permission to buy and own firearms. An investigation by The New York Times in 2011 found that many states had opened up new avenues for people with significant mental health problems to have their histories expunged, and thus acquire guns. Mr. Christie said the proposed law would only confuse matters in “an already cumbersome area of the law.”

The State Senate voted to override Mr. Christie’s veto of the bill — the first time that has happened on any veto since he took office in January 2010 — but on Thursday, the bill’s sponsor in the Assembly, a Democrat, decided to postpone a vote because he could not get enough Republicans to buck the governor. Even the Republican co-sponsor of the bill was unwilling to stand up for it against the Christie veto.

So it’s not just thoughts and prayers; it’s vetoes, too, and campaign boasts about blocking new laws.

But there’s even more happening around mass shootings than Mr. Christie’s prayers and vetoes.

A company that wants to get into the armoring of schools — hardening them against assaults — did a complete makeover of a school in Queens, St. Elizabeth’s Catholic Academy. The school now has bulletproof walls, double deadbolt locks, metal frames on doors, and surveillance cameras everywhere.

Another business opportunity was identified by a company in Oklahoma, which marketed bulletproof blankets to schools so that children could huddle under them during “active shootings.” They apparently would work as long as the assailant was not using high-velocity guns.

And of course, there is getting rid of the Confederate battle flag, which was the response to the killing of nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.C. You remember Charleston, right? That was not quite six months ago, June 17.

As a statement of revulsion, the South Carolina Legislature ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capital, an event that took place on July 10.

In the 144 days since then, 169 mass shootings have taken place across the country, according to data on shootingtracker.com.

“I am pretty sure we U.S. citizens threw out reason along with the baby and the bathwater when we decided that protecting kids with bulletproof gym mats” was the solution, Cordelia Newlin de Rojas wrote on the blog BluntMoms. Social media was mere posturing, she wrote: “Our computer screens are as effective as the bulletproof gym mats.”

Thoughts and prayers may be necessary, but they are demonstrably not sufficient, even for those who believe.

And for those who don’t, such as the New York actor and raconteur Malachy McCourt, hearing yet another invocation of “thoughts and prayers” can inspire acid responses.

2209,9621543.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/next-move-on-press-freedom.html,"Last July, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. spoke eloquently of “the importance of the constitutionally protected news gathering process,” the essential role of a free press when it comes to “government accountability and an open society,” and the need to better protect journalists from federal leak investigations.

At the time, he described policy revisions that supposedly would achieve those goals, including enhanced oversight by senior Justice Department officials and a new presumption that news organizations would be notified when the government sought their records from phone companies, Internet providers and other third parties.

Now, six months later, Mr. Holder says those policies are being followed, but he has yet to actually issue the new guidelines. And, most immediately, he has yet to call off the misguided quest by prosecutors to compel James Risen, a reporter for The Times, who wrote a 2006 book about the Central Intelligence Agency, to reveal a confidential source. Barely a week after Mr. Holder delivered his report to the White House, the Justice Department issued a statement declaring agreement with a chilling 2-to-1 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia, denying the existence of any reporters’ privilege, grounded in the First Amendment, to protect confidential sources in criminal cases.

That has been the department’s position on the case from its start to Mr. Risen’s failed appeal in January to the full circuit court. It is sharply at odds with the nearly universal consensus among states that reporters have a common law privilege to protect confidential sources. It also runs counter to the finding by a federal district judge, Leonie Brinkema, and the dissenting appeals judge, Roger Gregory, that the government has ample evidence to proceed with the prosecution without making a reporter give up a source or go to jail. So much for Mr. Holder’s talk of respecting “constitutionally protected” news gathering and not threatening journalists with jail for doing their jobs, except in “extraordinary” circumstances.

Mr. Risen has asked the Supreme Court to review his case. But the best resolution would be for Mr. Holder to reconsider Mr. Risen’s subpoena, in keeping with the letter and spirit of his new guidelines. A group of media organizations, including The Times, has been urging just that.

It is too late to erase the damage stemming from the Risen case and other egregious attacks on a free press on Mr. Holder’s watch. But reducing the stain on Mr. Holder’s legacy, and building a better legacy, begins with dropping the demand that Mr. Risen testify about his sources.",2018-02-11 00:47:18.072849,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Next Move on Press Freedom,The Editorial Board,,"['Risen  James', 'Holder  Eric H Jr', 'Justice Department', 'News Sources  Confidential Status of', 'Freedom of the Press', 'Supreme Court (US)', 'Editorials']",The United States attorney general should seize the opportunity to demonstrate his expressed respect for “constitutionally protected” news gathering.,,,nytimes

MADISON, WI — Vile. Racist. A “direct threat.” One Wisconsin lawmaker used these words to describe a video made by a group of students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The video in question depicts the beheading of a police officer.

In the video, students dressed as officers wearing pig masks, including one leading a black student to a noose made of the U.S. flag. Later, a machete-wielding black student chases the officers before the video cuts to a frame of the student holding a bloody, decapitated pig mask.

The video was produced and directed by Eneale Pickett, a junior at the university, as a commercial to promote a clothing line he created with an anti-police message. He did not immediately respond to an email and a message through his Twitter account Thursday.

Republican state Sen. Steve Nass said in a statement Wednesday that the video is “vile and racist” and “clearly a direct threat to the brave men and women that serve behind the badge.” He urged the local police and the Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate and called on the university to hold the students involved accountable.

The university said in a statement that while it condemns and rejects the video’s “glorification of violence,” ”all citizens have the rights to express political beliefs that others may find objectionable, or even counter to the values of the institution.” The statement said the university supports police and does not endorse the student’s clothing line.

Police expressed a similar sentiment.

“We do not agree with the message, but we appreciate and respect people’s opinions and their right to free speech,” said Marc Lovicott, a spokesman for university’s police department. Lovicott said police are not investigating because no crimes were committed.

The video is voiced-over with soundbites from President Donald Trump’s remarks following the deadly clashes last month at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The video begins with Trump saying, “You had a group on the other side that was also very violent and nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now.”

The video ends with the image of the beheaded mask and Trump’s words: “You look at both sides, I think there’s blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don’t have any doubt about it either.”

Does Windows 8 have a DVD player program for watching movies? If so, how do I find it?

A.

Windows 8 does not include a default video player for watching movies on DVD. In a company blog post last year, Microsoft representatives cited the decline in disc sales and licensing fees for DVD player software as factors in the decision. Windows 8 should be able to read data stored on DVD discs; if not, check with your hardware manufacturer for troubleshooting tips.

The lack of built-in software should not stop you from playing DVD movies on your computer. If you have Windows 8 Pro, you can download and add on the Windows Media Center Pack software for $10 to get DVD playback capability; those with just Windows 8 need the $100 Windows Pro Pack to add a compatible version of Windows Media Center to their systems. Microsoft’s site explains how to buy the software and has more information on playing DVDs for various editions of Windows.

While you can find DVD player apps in the Windows Store, you may not have to go that far or spend any money. If you bought a new computer with both a DVD drive and Windows 8 preinstalled, see if the manufacturer included a program for handling DVDs. If not, VideoLAN’s open-source software, VLC media player, can play DVD movies.

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel already has cabinet and parliamentary approval to withdraw the settlers from Gaza and four small West Bank settlements. But the settlers and their supporters say they will press ahead with protests, believing that Mr. Sharon's plan could still collapse.

""We're not prophets, but we're the sons of prophets, and we know that anything could still happen,"" said Natan Fagan, 46, who brought his wife and their six children from their home in the Jerusalem area to take part.

As with previous big rallies organized by the settlers, it was largely a family affair. Couples and their children came from many parts of Israel, with entire families dressed in orange T-shirts and caps. Orange is the chosen color of those who oppose the pullout.

Sleep deprivation ranks among the most beloved torture methods of dictators, religious cults, Inquisition leaders and garden-variety sadists. Roughly two years ago, when the Senate Intelligence Committee released its report on the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation techniques”—the genteel expression for torture—it revealed that, along with waterboarding and rectal feeding, the agency has a soft spot for sleep deprivation.

Most of us have not experienced the astounding cruelty of state-sanctioned torture, knock on wood, but we are familiar with the far less horrific experience of school- and job-related lack of sleep. Recent studies suggest that even this less extreme variety of sleep deprivation has real consequences, and some experts say, as a culture, we’re scheduling the day all wrong.

Among those voices is Paul Kelley, a neuroscientist and research associate at Oxford University’s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute. Kelley believes work and school days generally begin too early and run counter to the natural circadian rhythms of adolescents and adults under the age of 55. He says all that lost sleep causes big problems that can ultimately pose “threats to health, mood performance and mental health.”

“At the age of 10 you get up and go to school and it fits in with our nine-to-five lifestyle,” Kelley told attendees of last year’s British Science Festival, according to the Guardian. “When you are about 55 you also settle into the same pattern. But in between it changes a huge amount.”

While we’ve been culturally conditioned to suck it up and get on with it, so to speak, the good doctor says you can’t simply override millions of years of evolution where sleep is concerned. For starters, “[y]our liver and your heart have different patterns and you’re asking them to shift two or three hours,” according to Kelley. “We cannot change our 24-hour rhythms. You cannot learn to get up at a certain time. Your body will be attuned to sunlight and you’re not conscious of it because it reports to hypothalamus, not sight.”

Instead, he suggests, work days should start “around three hours later, which is entirely natural.” That sounds like a solution we can all get on board with; a sacrifice we should all be willing to make for the sake of science.

“Staff should start at 10am,” Kelley says, according to Buzzfeed News. “You don’t get back to [a natural 9am schedule] starting point until 55. Staff are usually sleep-deprived. We’ve got a sleep-deprived society. It is hugely damaging on the body’s systems because you are affecting physical, emotional and performance systems in the body.”

“This applies in the bigger picture to prisons and hospitals,” Kelley adds. “They wake up people and give people food they don’t want. You’re more biddable because you’re totally out of it. Sleep deprivation is a torture.”

Kelley also thinks school hours should be modified to better sync with the “internal clocks” of most students, and says the adjustment will allow their brains to follow. The scientist believes optimized learning for a 10-year-old would mean a school day that begins after 8:30am. For 16-year-olds, the day would start at 10am and college students would have their first class at 11am. The former head teacher of a middle school in his native England, Kelley shifted the days’ beginning from 8:30am to 10am, after which he says top grades increased by 19 percent. He posits that a similar time shift in other schools could help push up grades by 10 percent.

To test this idea, Kelley has launched a project called Teensleep along with neuroscientist and Oxford University colleague Russell Foster and Harvard Medical School professor Steven Lockley. The pilot project and study will compare how students fare in schools with traditional early start times versus those that begin at 10am.

Kelley isn’t the only one calling for schools to get things rolling later. As the Atlantic noted in a story last year, both the Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that schools schedule classes later in the morning so students can get the necessary sleep they need to make the most of the learning day. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has even said it might not be such a bad idea. An Atlantic-cited study from the University of Minnesota’s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement seems to offer yet more support for letting kids get more sleep:

Researchers analyzed data from more than 9,000 students at eight high schools in Minnesota, Colorado, and Wyoming and found that shifting the school day later in the morning resulted in a boost in attendance, test scores, and grades in math, English, science, and social studies. Schools also saw a decrease in tardiness, substance abuse, and symptoms of depression. Some even had a dramatic drop in teen car crashes.

As the CDC notes, 42 states report their public schools begin before 8:30am, while 40 percent of high schools around the country actually start before 8am. School days beginning that early might allow younger students to get the sleep they need, but studies show natural shifts in circadian rhythms result in older kids going to sleep later and later. Adolescents and teens aren’t lazy; their biology is changing a lot and sleep is part of that. Yet there remains fairly strong resistance to changing school hours, with opponents citing multiple reasons for keeping things the way they are. Some experts suggest that refusal to consider the benefits is just another symptom of our culture of overwork.

“I get tired of the argument that these kids have to do all these activities and community service and therefore can’t start school later,” Kyla Wahlstrom, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement, told Scientific American. “The issue is not the start time. It’s that the students are overly busy. There is too much pressure to cram it all in just to have a good resume to get into college.”

Whether or not you believe our work and school days should get off to a later start, one thing isn’t up for debate: most of us aren’t getting nearly enough sleep. In fact, a 2013 Gallup survey found a whopping 40 percent of American adults get less than the recommended allowance of seven to nine hours of sleep a night. The CDC cites insufficient sleep as a public health issue. And the UK’s National Health Service reports that one third of Brits don’t get the sleep they need. It is, Kelley puts it, a “huge society” problem, and pervasive cultural notions are hard to change.

“This is an international issue,” Kelley laments. “Everybody is suffering and they don’t have to.”",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Having to work before 10 am is ‘torture’ — according to science,"Kali Holloway, About The Author",,[''],,,,

(File) The Reserve Bank Friday came out with the draft guidelines for centralised hedging for local subsidiaries of foreign companies. The overseas parent of a company or its central treasury can hedge the currency risks arising from genuine current account exposures of the local subsidiary to better manage the latter’s currency risk, the RBI said in a notification.
The RBI, which had first announced the move in the October policy review, has invited comments on the draft rules by November 11. The purpose of the new policy is “to provide greater flexibility for hedging the currency risks arising from current account transactions of domestic subsidiaries of multinationals by the parent or any non-resident group entity”, the central bank said.
It is proposed that such companies will be able to hedge in all foreign currency-rupee derivatives. But to avail of the facility, the foreign entity will have to be incorporated here, as India is member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the draft guidelines said.

58,73.0,coed.com,fake,https://coed.com/2018/01/22/college-basketball-rankings-week-12-power-standing-projections-top-25/,"Every college basketball fan knows all too well how prevalent upsets can be during any given week of this cantankerous and infinitely enjoyable sport. But this week…it was a rough time for any program that had a number next to the name of their respective academic institutions. Not only did four of the top 10 teams in the country lose this week, but three of those four supposed top tier programs lost twice! Simply put, last week was a bombshell of utter chaos and confusion as many perennial National Title contenders sustained questionable losses and will have to rebound valiantly if they have any hope of garnering a favorable seed come March Madness. While the highly anticipated tournament is still roughly two months away, this is the time where the truly great programs need to separate themselves from the overconfident pretenders that will inevitably continue to drop down the rankings into the dreaded basement of irrelevancy.

1. Villanova Wildcats

With an offense that both scores (87.9 PPG) and moves the basketball effectively (17.6 APG), the Wildcats have rarely been reliant on their average defense to help them overcome most of the opponents they have faced in the Big East. Although no team is safe at the top of the rankings, the Wildcats have been merciless when it comes to out scoring their opponents early and are not showing any signs of slowing down in that department.

2. Virginia Cavaliers

You know that story. The Cavaliers are fantastic on defense and play well enough offensively to score aggressively in transition and underneath the basket in half-court situations. If the Cavaliers can take out the highly prolific Blue Devils this week, they will have emphatically proved that a top-ranked defense is more than enough to win consistently and to potentially go far in the NCAA Tournament.

3. Purdue Boilermakers

The only bad thing you can say about the Boilermakers is that they have not played a ranked opponent since defeating Louisville earlier in the season (November 28th). With that being said, Purdue has done exactly what an elite program is supposed to do: they have almost always handily defeated the unranked opposition they have encountered. With Michigan coming into town for a revenge contest, the Boilermakers will get another opportunity to prove that they should rightfully be considered one of the best programs in the country.

4. Duke Blue Devils

During their last four games, the Duke Blue Devils have been playing well to fantastic defensively as they have held their opponents to 75 points or less during their four-game winning streak. Granted, these impressive defensive showings came against Pittsburgh twice, Wake Forest and Miami, but at least Duke has finally realized that if they can at least be average at preventing their opponents from scoring that they can be one of the best programs in the country down the stretch of the regular season.

5. Xavier Musketeers

Overcoming Seton Hall in their latest victory thanks to some impressive shooting late in the game, the Musketeers are once again vying for the top spot in the Big East. Although it would be wishful thinking for the top-ranked Wildcats to slip up anytime soon, the Musketeers have to be chomping at the bit to get revenge against the Wildcats when they face each other again on February 17th.

6. Kansas Jayhawks

Although a close call win over Baylor at home revealed some lingering issues with this programs inconsistency issues when scoring the basketball, their tenacity on the defensive end has been their saving grace in their last three wins. If the Jayhawks can get an impressive win over Oklahoma this week, they could create some much-desired separation between themselves and the rest of the Big 12.

7. Michigan State Spartans

Although it’s been a bumpy road for the Spartans in their last four games (2-2), there is not much doubt how great this team can be on offense and defense when they are firing on all cylinders (85.2 PPG, 63.7 PAPG). Considering they do not face a ranked opponent until February 10th (Purdue), the Spartans should be able to work out their inconsistency issues without suffering too much in terms of sustaining upset defeats.

8. Cincinnati Bearcats

Although the offense of the Bearcats has been anything but productive for the most part, they have actually stepped up impressively in three of their last four games (have scored 76 points or more in those affairs). Defensively, the Bearcats have been nothing short of terrific as they have not allowed an opponent to score more than 60 total points since December 21st against Cleveland State.

9. North Carolina Tar Heels

Holding three of their last four opponents to under 70 total points, the Tar Heels are beginning to establish themselves as something more than just a relentless shooting program. If the Tar Heels can consistently stifle opponents defensively while relentlessly shooting the ball at a high rate (82.7 PPG), they could quickly become one of the favorites to win it all by the end of the season.

10. West Virginia Mountaineers

Despite losing two of their last three games, the Mountaineers have remained true to their identity of playing dominant defense. However, their offense has come up short in their two recent losses to Kansas and Texas Tech, something that can be fixed fairly easily considering four of their five starters are currently averaging double-digit points per game.

11. Arizona Wildcats

Despite looking wildly inconsistent on offense and defense recently, the scrappy Wildcats have been able to play well enough on either side of the court to win tight games down the stretch. In order for the Wildcats to continue their winning ways, they will need their electric offense to step consistently if they hope to reach their potential of being considered National Title contenders (82.2 PPG).

12. Gonzaga Bulldogs

Against Saint Mary’s, the Bulldogs had a grand opportunity to assert themselves as a legitimately competitive program that could at least beat the one competitive opponent in their conference. Unfortunately for Gonzaga, they were unable to convert on enough possessions to beat a well-rounded Saint Mary’s team that will likely hold onto the top spot in the West Coast Conference until these two programs face off again in mid-February.

13. Ohio State Buckeyes

Undefeated in Big 10 Conference play (8-0), the surprising and highly competitive Buckeyes have ground out several impressive victories thanks to their now elite defense (have held six of their last seven opponents to under 70 total points). Although they may not have the dominant athletes like some of the perceived elite programs in college basketball, they have enough reliable shooters to assist a defense that is finally starting to hit its stride.

14. Auburn Tigers

Aside from a devastating loss to Alabama, the Tigers have been a program that has continued to persevere despite being hit particularly hard by the FBI probe that resulted with two of their best players being suspended indefinitely. If they can continue to play the glass this effectively while converting their extra opportunities into points (85.3 PPG, 72.4 PAPG), they could win the SEC outright by the end of the regular season.

15. Arizona State Sun Devils

While the Sun Devils are clearly trending downward, they have been the fortunate beneficiaries of some immense chaos above them while winning enough close games to keep themselves relevant in the Pac-12. Eventually, though, the Sun Devils will be in danger of dropping out of the rankings if their gifted sharpshooters continue to fail when it comes to carrying this exciting albeit one-dimensional offense.

16. Oklahoma Sooners

Even when superstar Trae Young scores 48 points in a game (see the loss to Oklahoma State), the Sooners still do not have what it takes to win against lesser opponents. Turning over the ball at an alarming rate of 14 times per game (Young contributes over five turnovers per game) while allowing 81.6 PPG, the Sooners are finally being punished for playing too loose with the basketball and are coming to the realization that you need more than an electric offense to win in a sport that is rife with parity and worthy competitors.

17. Texas Tech Red Raiders

Without question, it was a tough week for some of the top-ranked teams in the Big 12. However, the Red Raiders arguably suffered the most as they have lost three of their last four games, with their last two losses coming against opponents that are currently in the basement of the Big 12 standings (Texas, Iowa State). While their defense has played enough, it has been their progressively worsening offense that has done them in during this tough stretch (have not scored more than 75 in their last five games).

18. Wichita State Shockers

One of several top-ranked programs to lose twice last week, the once fearlessly competitive Shockers dropped back-t0-back games to unranked opponents for the first time since November 2015. While the Shockers have the prolific offense to bounce back, their lack of effort on the defensive end recently has to be rectified if they hope to reclaim the moniker of being one of the top programs in college basketball.

19. Saint Mary’s Gaels

With a thrilling win against their hated rivals in the Gonzaga Bulldogs on the road, the Gaels have firmly taken hold of the top spot in the West Coast Conference and will likely hold onto that coveted spot for the remainder of the season. Effective on both offense and defense (80.1 PPG, 65.9 PAPG), the Gaels have the discipline and personnel to become a dark horse program once the NCAA Tournament commences.

20. Tennessee Volunteers

With a 4-3 record in the SEC, the Volunteers are doing just enough to keep themselves near the top of their conference standings. Although their finicky offense is a serious concern (77.7 PPG), the Volunteers have been able to overcome their noticeable deficiencies by playing strong defense down the stretch of close games.

21. Clemson Tigers

While the unlikely success story of the Tigers has begun to become less majestic and intriguing in their last four games (2-2), they have nevertheless remained committed to grinding out tough victorious with an opportunistic defense that prides itself on preventing their opponents from making easy shots (six BPG). It may not always be pretty, but the Tigers have an established identity that has proven to be effective more often than not.

22. Michigan Wolverines

Although Michigan’s anemic offense looked particularly dreadful in a 72-52 loss to Nebraska last week, the physically imposing Wolverines were able to overcome this brutal defeat by winning their other two games last week against both Maryland and Rutgers. While the Wolverines have to establish some type of continuity as a shooting team if they hope to remain in the conversation as a Big 10 title contender (74.5 PPG), their relentless defense should be able to carry them until they can establish a more dynamic and competitive presence offensively (62.5 PAPG).

23. Kansas State Wildcats

Although the Wildcats are not particularly dominant on either offense or defense, they are a team that knows how to play the big boys of their conference extremely tough (won two of their last three games, all contests were against ranked opponents). If this team can continue to be tenacious when it comes to forcing turnovers (eight SPG) they could find themselves being one of the top dogs in the incredibly competitive and deep Big 12 Conference.

24. Creighton Blue Jays

Considering how this season has transpired for the Blue Jays thus far, this program should have a place reserved in spots 23-25 of the rankings every other week. Just when it appears that the Blue Jays are going cold shooting wise and lack a sufficient defense to be competitive, they somehow manage to rally and pull off an impressive win over a conference opponent. With the Blue Jays facing the deadly Wildcats in a couple of weeks, it becomes fair to wonder if this team has the potential to become a sleeper contender if they can play great basketball consistently.

25. Rhode Island Rams

Over the past couple of weeks, the defensively scrappy Rams have been flirting with a spot in the top-25 and have sneaked their way in the rankings this week due to the immense amount of chaos above them. Currently riding a 10 game winning streak, the Rams may have just enough going for them defensively to remain highly competitive in the A-10 Conference (66.7 PAPG).

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

(Before It's News)

Back when I was a musician – writing songs rather than things like this – I was just about the only one I knew who wasn’t stealing music via the heist website Napster. And I lived in Austin, Texas – the “Live Music Capital of the World.” I knew a LOT of musicians.

Napster was “originally founded as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet service that emphasized sharing audio files, typically music, encoded in MP3 format. The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement….”

Translation: People downloaded music – for which they never paid. Hence the “legal difficulties over copyright infringement.” Napster was a monster music shopping mall – without the shopping.

The arguments in defense of this theft were (and remain) patently (no pun intended) absurd. Some of the absurdest:

“The musicians make money from touring – we’re only stealing from the record companies.”

A microcosm of the Democrats’ “Tax the evil rich to pay for free stuff for you” mantra. Which is obnoxious. Stealing from anyone – is stealing. Oh – and of course musicians get paid for their music. Unless their music is stolen.

“I’m not stealing anything physical. It’s not like I’m taking a compact disc. So they’re not out anything.”

Behold the absolutely ridiculous “Intellectual property isn’t property” assertion. Even many center-right and libertarian people and outfits – some of some stature – lamely put this forward.

But a compact disc – bereft of Adele, Drake or Taylor Swift – is nothing more than high-tech plastic. You’re not stealing it to get the high-tech plastic – you want what’s encoded thereon.

It’s the musical ideas – which beget the music, the recording, the marketing and the teenage madness – that matter. These ideas – are intellectual property.

Thus is intellectual property, in fact, MORE important than physical property – not less. And it always has been.

Technological advances don’t change any of this. New platforms – same principles. Stealing vinyl records – was wrong. So too was stealing 8-track tapes. And cassettes. And CDs. Stealing MP3s – is stealing.

Napster was only a toe-in-the-water beginning. The theft of digital goods – music, movies, computer software,… – has only exponentially grown. Into a HUGE global problem. (And that is not just a Kim Dotcom pun.) See also: China. And….

Of course there is always a constituency for free stuff (see, again: The Democrat Party). Some major players have in fact made it a key component of their business model (Hello, Google). These intellectual property thieves have lots of coin (because they rarely pay for anything) – so they can dress up their thievery quite nicely.

They can hire lots of lawyers and organizations to pretend that opposition to their thievery – is actually opposition to technological advancement. (When it, of course, defunds and undermines future technological advancement. If you can’t get paid for your last advancement – why on Earth would you or anyone else invest in your next?)

And these thieves can hire lots of lobbyists – to have law written that all-but-legalizes their theft. To wit: The Innovation and Patent Acts currently under consideration in Congress. Bills which would make it so much easier for people to do to patents – what thieves like Napster, China and Kim Dotcom do to copyrights (and trademarks). It would become dramatically more difficult for intellectual property holders – whose property protection device is patents – to stop the people who are stealing their ideas.

These bills are anti-intellectual property. And anti-property. And anti-technological advancement. And anti-capitalism. What they are – is pro-theft. It makes a lot of illegal thievery – a lot less subject to the law and its enforcement.

I understand why the thieves would want this. I have zero idea why anyone else does.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The Trump administration took a big step Tuesday towards repealing former President Barack Obama’s restrictions on opening a gold mine in Alaska.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposal to nix Obama’s plan to block the Pebble Mine to protect the state’s water quality and the area’s salmon population. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wants to give developers time to request mining permits from the Army Corps of Engineers without being blocked.

“A withdrawal of the proposed determination would remove any uncertainty, real or perceived, about [the developer’s] ability to submit a permit application and have that permit application reviewed,” the proposal noted.

Obama’s decision turned the mine into a political football. Environmentalists rallied around the blockage and Republicans railed against the move because they feared the president was overstepping his authority.

Activists believed that the mine would pollute streams running into nearby Bristol Bay, Alaska — the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery. Obama’s EPA agreed and worked to block the mine.

The EPA prevented the Pebble Mine from even applying for a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit after the urging of environmental groups and some Alaskan tribes, some of which were wary of more development in Bristol Bay.

An agency report in 2014 signaled to investors that the project had a slim chance at acquiring a federal permit. Mining company Rio Tinto pulled out of the project shortly after the EPA’s report was issued. Other companies shortly followed suit.

Republican lawmakers in the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology launched investigations into Obama’s decision and found that EPA ecologist Phil North worked with mine opponents to block Pebble Mine from being built.

Pruitt’s plan will be published in the Federal Register shortly, kicking off a three-month period for activists and shareholders to submit comments about the proposal. Obama initially blocked the mine in 2014.

Personally I think it is legit for the following reasons, first the old USSR would have been a natural' place of interest for aliens. Two the USSR was a military society and the military would have controlled any encounter with ufos. Three, surprisingly in many ways people find Russia to be more open today than the US is especially in subject areas concerning the paranormal which includes ufology. Lastly, the pictures are quite good and not recent and frankly difficult if not very expensive to fake unlike many ufo photos we have seen.

64,80.0,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/little-girls-reaction-to-shooting-her-first-deer-goes-viral-has-animal-activists-furious/,"In the YouTube video below, you’re going to see what can happen when you teach children how to use guns at a young age. Although this little princess is only seven-years-old, she is out hunting deer with a gun that looks to be about twice her size. And now that the video has gone viral because her reaction to killing the animal was utterly priceless, this little girl is the talk of Facebook. And the clip has been gotten more than 2.5 million hits on various video platforms.

The little girl in the video is Lilly Klapper, and she lives in North Texas. While out hunting for whitetail with her father and brother, Lilly was ready to take her first shot at a living animal. Her family trained her well during the last two years. She has done a lot of target practice and has been mentally preparing for the hunt.

But nothing could have prepared her for the THRILL of making a direct hit and taking down the deer.

The girl’s father, Cory Klapper, is a dedicated hunter. And he was the one to get the monumental moment on video.

Although the hunt happened back on November 28, Klapper finally got the footage onto Facebook only this Tuesday. And before he knew what was happening, his beloved daughter, Lilly, had become a viral sensation and the talk of the internet.

“We have a passion for the outdoors, and it was primarily intended to be for family and friends,” Klapper told FOX 4. “But now…I hope that it inspires other parents to get their children into the outdoors.”

Lilly is manning an AR-style rifle “chambered in 300 blackouts” bullets, her dad said. She is completely focused on killing the whitetail.

“Shoot the big one in the middle if you can,” her dad encourages the young girl. She listens to his advice and aims. Then she prepares to pull the trigger.

It takes two minutes before the shot presents itself, but when it does, she pulls the trigger, and everyone erupts into celebration.

“You got it, baby! You got it!” her father cheers.

The excitement takes a while to make sense to her. But when she realizes that she’s killed her first deer, her mouth hangs open and turns into a big smile.

People around the country shared their support to the hunting family.

“This is amazing!! That’s a dad teaching some life skills right there!” wrote one Facebook user. “SUCH A GREAT DAD!!!! I have never hunted and hated seeing the animals in Africa hunted and all that, but this is so awesome what you did with your daughter,” another added. “You can see how proud she is of herself!!! She is so focused and patient!! GO DAD!!!!”

One admirer added, “We have become a nation of powder puffs. Thank God for Dads like you. Am teaching my grandson to shoot. Kids need this, as it teaches responsible behavior.”

And as a great hunter once said:

“A family that hunts together stays together.”

What’s your reaction to the footage?",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Little Girl’s Reaction To Shooting Her First Deer Goes Viral, Has Animal Activists Furious",Alexander Smith,,[''],,,,

(Before It's News)

Do you guys remember that heartbreaking Disney movie (I know, which one, right?) The Fox and the Hound? Well here’s the real life version! Sadie the Jack Russell Terrier and eight-month-old Anuska the vixen have become unlikely friends after Anuska was orphaned days after her birth when her mother was run over by a car.

Luckily, Sadie was there to fill in for mom. Now they two are never apart from one another – taking nice long walks, catching tennis balls, and having the occasional wrestling match.

Their owner, Brian Bevan, 62, from Biggleswade, Bedfordshire says that “Anuska loves playing catch. She could do it all day long. She leaps for the ball but she also likes berries, so she’ll happily jump to pick those off branches too. It’s hardly surprising to see a dog jumping around but watching a fox do it is something else,” said Mr Bevan.

Anuska and eight other cubs had been rescued by a farmer who dug them out of their den after recognising their mother’s body on a road. All the kits had gotten used to being around dogs, since the farmer owned Labrador Retrievers.

The little foxes have all since found homes.

There are 6 times periods, and each has its own archetypal theme and symbolism and significant number symbolism. In the current time period, the number 30 is significant. The 30th week.The 30th week is the week of viability in reference to an unborn child's ability to survive outside the womb (premature birth) or die. So I was looking in the mainstream news for stories about children. I had believed that a certain missing child would be located during this week 30. But it did not happen. Instead we got a story of a child shot dead in Florida..... Trayvon Martin. Dead. That indicates a total lack of viability. Also, during that week 30, we got a story of Jason Russell (KONY 2012 director) going all naked psycho on the sidewalk. To get naked is to ''divest''. See how this works? ~They~ were sending a signal to divest oneself of ones possessions (stocks) due to lack of viability at this time. You have to know the time.What do you know about that, Pelvi?Words are powerful. Ideas are powerful. Did you know that Jason Russell co-founded Invisible Children, Inc.? All about trying to stop the kidnapping of young children who are used to fight in a rebel army (male) or to be sold into sexual slavery (female). Bizarre, eh?

Tess Daly, now 48 - who presents Strictly Come Dancing alongside Claudia Winkleman, 45 - could be seen looking as gorgeous as ever as she oozed confidence while posing for the 1989 pictures. Tess showcased her slim physique in a beige high-waisted skirt, which she teamed with a white top and a matching cropped jacket. The beauty grinned for the camera as she pushed her hair back away from her face in a sexy manner, with her keeping her make-up natural-looking and completing the casual chic look with a pair of dangling statement earrings.

Tess wore a pair of long shorts, a white jumper and a striped top tied loosely around her waist. She wore her brunette locks in a blow-dried style and she wore some nude lipstick and lashings of mascara to highlight her stunning features. Tess’ old school photographs come after her co-host Claudia pretended to fall over on last weekend’s Strictly. The pair were chatting about Karen Clifton’s banana headdress, with Claudia saying, while pulling out a half-eaten banana: ""Yep, with one less banana - absolutely delicious.""

Organizing for Action, which has pledged not to take money from lobbyists and says on their website that they will not engage in lobbying, has registered as a lobbying group in New York state, according to public records.

""We anticipate Organizing for Action will exceed the $$5,000 threshold for lobbying,"" OFA Chief of Staff Grant Campbell wrote in a letter to the state’s ethics commission on March 27.

OFA, President Barack Obama’s dark money group, recently joined with two other New York lobbying organizations, the Public Campaign Action Fund and Citizens Action of New York, to advocate for New York campaign finance reform legislation.

Campaign finance attorneys say organizations must register as lobbyists in New York if they spend more than $$5,000 to influence state legislation. Registered lobbyists must disclose details about their advocacy spending.

""In New York, if you engage in any sort of a call to action on the part of government, whether you do it directly … or you do it indirectly … that’s lobbying,"" one New York-based attorney who specializes in state lobbying law told the Washington Free Beacon last month.

""If Organizing for Action either hires someone or has an in-house person and their expenses exceed $$5,000, then they’re obliged to register under New York state law,"" the attorney added.

Organizing for Action says on its website that it would not engage in lobbying.

""OFA will not directly lobby elected officials on behalf of the policies it supports, nor will it hire lobbyists to do so. It is an advocacy organization that will promote these programs throughout the nation and will mobilize citizens to speak out for their adoption and implementation,"" the group’s website says.

The group has taken a hardline approach against lobbyists in the past, and has said it will not accept contributions from federally registered lobbyists.

OFA director Jon Carson said the election finance reform campaign was a ""historic opportunity"" for the organization to help ""give New Yorkers the campaign finance system they want and deserve,"" during the conference call with New York Attorney General Schneiderman organized by OFA in March.

Schneiderman has been working to enact stricter campaign finance laws, including public financing for elections.

''And if they do occur, they are surprisingly rare.''

Israel has not confronted a Jewish militant group of any size for nearly 20 years. It dealt with several in the 1980's, including one that smuggled 22 pounds of explosives and 18 hand grenades onto the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the site of the revered Aksa Mosque, before being chased away by a Palestinian guard. The very idea of vigilantism is troubling to Israel, both because of the threat to its own rule of law and its contention that violence against civilians is perpetrated only by the Palestinian side.

''I don't think any normal state can allow herself any underground,'' said Shlomi Swisa, a researcher for B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights group.

In this recent case, there has been no public word about the group's scope, even whether its members have carried out any of the seven unsolved attacks or were only planning new ones. The men themselves have apparently kept mum, too, despite intense interrogation.

If such a militant group exists, it is no surprise that it exists here in Hebron, where roughly 500 Jewish settlers live among more than 100,000 Palestinians. It is the site of the Tomb of the Patriarchs, the burial place among others of Abraham, revered by Jews and Arabs alike.

That, however, does little to describe the air of rage, violence and entitlement that hangs over streets now empty as a ghost town: empty of the Palestinians who fled curfews and harassment by settlers and the army that protects them; empty, too, of Israelis who fear to venture out and those who have been killed -- some 20 soldiers and settlers, according to the settlers, since November alone.

One settler who died in 2001, on March 26, was Mr. Pas's only child, hit in the head by a bullet fired from the nearby Abu Sneinah neighborhood. Despite that, David Wilder, a spokesman for Hebron's Jews, said he and his neighbors could not believe that Mr. Pas, who he said has picked up his life and had two more children, would assemble a vigilante group.

''He's not stupid,'' Mr. Wilder said, adding that the official position of the Jews in Hebron is squarely against vigilantism. ''He understands that it's very difficult in Israel to get away with murder.''

Mr. Pas, he said, came here years ago as a yeshiva student -- there are some 300 studying here -- then married a woman who grew up here. It was not the first attack on the immediate family: his wife's father was severely wounded by Palestinians wielding axes in the early 1990's. Several years later, her twin sister was stabbed, and last month, the sister's husband was arrested with Mr. Pas.

The argument about whether Jewish vigilantism is justified can quickly become contentious. One of the few points of agreement is that attacks by Israeli civilians against Palestinians are rare. According to B'Tselem, 32 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli civilians in the last three years. At the same time, 328 Israeli civilians have been killed by Palestinians inside Israel, and 190 more in the West Bank and Gaza.

But Mr. Swisa, the human rights researcher, said the reason for the scarcity of Jewish vigilantism is that, in fact, most Israelis believe that the army is protecting them well enough.

''They don't need a Jewish underground,'' he said. ''The army apparently does enough to protect them and does it very hard, for their taste.''

Palestinians argue that far more of them -- 2,103, according to B'Tselem -- have been killed by Israeli soldiers in the last three years. Moreover, they argue, the Palestinians do not have an army -- the reason many Palestinians defend their own terror attacks while deploring the same acts by Israelis.

Palestinians here point to an incident that occurred on July 19, 2001, about 9 p.m., when seven members of the Tamaizi family were driving home from a wedding party. A car on the main road flicked its high beams to let them pull out, then opened fire on them. Three people inside were killed, including a two-and-a-half-month-old boy who, like Shalhevet Pas, was an only child.

A Jewish militant group calling itself the Committee for Security on the Roads claimed responsibility.

The boy's grandfather, Helmi Musalem Tamaizi, 62, said today that he hoped that the case might finally be solved with the recent arrests. As he spoke, another grandchild, Amira, who was 30 months old when she was hit by a high velocity round in the car, shattering her left foot at the ankle, limped by.

Now all the truth is out,

Be secret and take defeat

For how can you compete,

But these don't appear to be good days for stoicism in the face of defeat. People in the spotlight are having a hard time facing the fact that they couldn't get it done. There just doesn't seem to be any such thing as an honorable loss.

Last Saturday, Ohio State and Michigan played football. The game was, as they say, ""eagerly anticipated,"" and the television ratings were, to use a word currently in vogue, ""huge."" And it turned out to be a good game. The teams played hard but they also made mistakes. As did the officials. Which provoked the wrath of Jim Harbaugh, who coaches the Michigan team and is paid some $$9 million a year for his labors. He takes the job seriously and the losses painfully. He has a volcanic temper.

At one point in the game, Harbaugh thought his team had been victimized by the officials. He yanked a headset off and slammed it on the ground hard enough to break it. He also said words that were provocative enough and loud enough to draw an ""unsportsmanlike conduct"" penalty from the officials. It was a 15-yard gift that helped Ohio State on its way to a touchdown.

With the two teams tied at the end of regulation, the game went into overtime. Both teams scored touchdowns in their first possessions and the game went to a second overtime period. In this one, after Michigan had kicked a field goal, Ohio State faced a fourth down and short. A field goal would tie the game and send it to another overtime period. A first down would keep the drive going and Ohio State could still win the game with a touchdown. But if Ohio State did not pick up the first down, the game would be over and they would lose it.

The Ohio State quarterback, J. T. Barrett, ran for the first down and it was exceedingly close. So close that the officials spent several minutes reviewing the initial call, which had been that Barrett made barely enough ground. It was impossible to know, watching on television, if Barrett had actually gained enough. But after the reviews, the original ruling was upheld, and Ohio State went on to win on a touchdown run by Barrett.

At the postgame press conference, Harbaugh came out smoking. He shouldn't have been called unsportsmanlike, he said, still fuming. His players got flagged for infractions that were overlooked when committed by Ohio State players. And then there was that call on the fourth-down run in the second overtime. As he saw it, Harbaugh said, Ohio State was short by ""this much,"" spreading his hands by half-a-foot or so.

It is hard to imagine what Harbaugh intended to accomplish by this petulant exhibition. The game was over and the final score was in the books. Michigan wasn't going to get the win on appeal. Ohio State officials and fans weren't likely to agree that Michigan had been hosed and say, ""How about a do-over?""

Harbaugh, of course, knew this. He probably also knew that his complaining actually took something off what was the dignity of a tough, close loss. He and his players came up short, though not by much, and there is no shame in this. But he seemed to believe it was insupportable. The fix had to be in. The thing was rigged. They'd been had.

In this, Harbaugh was operating in perfect harmony with the spirit of the times. Before the election, Donald Trump had hinted that he would not accept the results if he were defeated. The plain implication was that he believed there was no way he could lose unless the election were rigged. This assertion was greeted with predictable and justifiable outrage from the expected quarters. Talk like this was damaging to the trust and respect upon which our democracy depends and so forth.

So, Donald Trump won the election, and now, there is talk of recounts. These would take place in three states, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. These recounts began as the project of minor-party candidate Jill Stein, but the Clinton campaign soon signed on, though its leaders said they were not especially confident the results would go their way. Still, the recount cause would require cash, and it may be that when there is an opportunity to do a little political fundraising, the Clinton operation can't bear to stay on the sidelines. Raising money is what they do best.

The recount effort, meanwhile, provoked one of those intemperate tweets from President-elect Trump, who weighed in with this:

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.

Well . . . there is, of course, no proof of this. You could believe it in the same way that you could believe Michigan was hosed by the officials. Perhaps it does make the Clinton people feel better, temporarily, to force recounts in Ohio, Michigan, and, especially, Wisconsin, where they couldn't be bothered to campaign because they thought the state was in the bag for them. So the recount is, after a fashion, a second insult. We didn't care enough to come to your state to campaign and now we don't trust you enough to believe you counted the votes accurately.

This, in a way, replicates that Harbaugh performance. In his view, the other team got a six-inch gift from the officials and that cost Michigan the game. No mention of the two critical interceptions and the fumble committed by his quarterback or, especially, of the 15 yards awarded to Ohio State because the Michigan coach couldn't keep a cork in it.

And in a class called “The English Major in the Workplace,” at the University of Texas, Austin, students read “Death of a Salesman” but also learn to network, write a résumé and come off well in an interview.

Even before they arrive on campus, students — and their parents — are increasingly focused on what comes after college. What’s the return on investment, especially as the cost of that investment keeps rising? How will that major translate into a job?

The pressure on institutions to answer those questions is prompting changes from the admissions office to the career center. But even as they rush to prove their relevance, colleges and universities worry that students are specializing too early, that they are so focused on picking the perfect major that they don’t allow time for self-discovery, much less late blooming.

“The phrase drives me crazy — ‘What are you going to do with your degree?’ — but I see increasing concerns about that,” says Katharine Brooks, director of the liberal arts career center at the University of Texas, Austin, and author of “You Majored in What? Mapping Your Path From Chaos to Career.” “Particularly as money gets tighter, people are going to demand more accountability from majors and departments.”

Consider the change captured in the annual survey by the University of California, Los Angeles, of more than 400,000 incoming freshmen. In 1971, 37 percent responded that it was essential or very important to be “very well-off financially,” while 73 percent said the same about “developing a meaningful philosophy of life.” In 2009, the values were nearly reversed: 78 percent identified wealth as a goal, while 48 percent were after a meaningful philosophy.

The shift in attitudes is reflected in a shifting curriculum. Nationally, business has been the most popular major for the last 15 years. Campuses also report a boom in public health fields, and many institutions are building up environmental science and just about anything prefixed with “bio.” Reflecting the new economic and global realities, they are adding or expanding majors in Chinese and Arabic. The University of Michigan has seen a 38 percent increase in students enrolling in Asian language courses since 2002, while French has dropped by 5 percent.

Of course, universities have always adjusted curriculum to reflect the changing world; Kim Wilcox, the provost and vice president for academic affairs at Michigan State, notes that universities, his included, used to offer majors in elocution and animal husbandry. In a major re-examination of its curriculum, Michigan State has added a dozen or so new programs, including degrees in global studies and, in response to a growing industry in the state, film studies. At the same time, it is abandoning underperformers like classical studies: in the last four years, only 13 students have declared it their major.

Dropping a classics or philosophy major might have been unthinkable a generation ago, when knowledge of the great thinkers was a cornerstone of a solid education. But with budgets tight, such programs have come to seem like a luxury— or maybe an expensive antique — in some quarters.

When Louisiana’s regents voted to eliminate the philosophy major last spring, they agreed with faculty members that the subject is “a traditional core program of a broad-based liberal arts and science institution.” But they noted that, on average, 3.4 students had graduated as philosophy majors in the previous five years; in 2008, there were none. “One cannot help but recognize that philosophy as an essential undergraduate program has lost some credence among students,” the board concluded.",2018-02-11 00:44:01.395044,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Making College ‘Relevant’,Kate Zernike,,"['Careers and Professions', 'Colleges and Universities', 'Education and Schools']",Students are increasingly focused on how their major will translate into a job.

9033,7710828.0,rinf.com,political,http://rinf.com/alt-news/breaking-news/dead-people-collecting-millions-in-social-security-benefits/,"The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been paying benefits to dead people – in some instances, for nearly two decades – according to a recent report from the SSA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).

“SSA issued payments to 2,475 beneficiaries for months and, in some cases, years after it received notification that they were deceased,” wrote OIG. “SSA received death reports for these individuals and recorded the dates of death on the Numident,” an electronic file that contains data on each individual with a Social Security number (SSN), but “did not record the death information on the beneficiaries’ payment records or terminate their payments.”

Of the 2,475 potentially deceased beneficiaries, OIG found that 1,546 had death certificate numbers in the Numident, “a reliable indicator that the numberholder is deceased.” On average, each of these dead individuals continued to receive a total of $$20,023 in benefits over a period of 20 months. However, some had been raking in the dough for a whopping 237 months – almost 20 years.

One beneficiary who died in April 2000 and whose date of death and death certificate number were recorded in the Numident in February 2001 was still getting paid as of May 2012, by which time taxpayers had been taken for approximately $$158,000 in benefits. According to a footnote in the report, the SSA finally terminated this individual’s benefits in August 2012, after which an OIG investigation “revealed a family member had access to the deceased beneficiary’s bank account and converted $$160,101 in benefit payments for his own use.”

All told, OIG estimated that these deceased individuals (or their unscrupulous relatives) have taken in about $$31 million in benefits. Those who remain on the rolls are expected to cost taxpayers another $$15 million over the next year if the SSA does not terminate their benefits.

Another 879 individuals identified as deceased by the SSA may or may not be dead, said OIG. Dates of death were recorded in the database, but death certificate numbers were not. A search of public records concerning a random sample of these individuals indicated that at least a third of them are still alive. The SSA will therefore need to proceed cautiously in determining which ones have passed away. As OIG observed, if the agency were to declare a living soul dead, this “could lead to benefit termination, cause severe financial hardship, and result in the public release of their” personal identifying information.

OIG was unable to determine whether the remaining 50 people identified as deceased in the Numident are dead or alive because “the SSN on the beneficiary’s payment record was not the beneficiary’s.” These are data-entry errors that the SSA will have to investigate further.

Why did so many dead people continue to receive benefits, and why were the records of others not corrected to reflect the fact that they were still alive?

“This occurred because various system controls designed to prevent or detect continued payments to deceased beneficiaries were not effective,” stated OIG. Benefits for 1,007 individuals should have been terminated immediately when Electronic Death Registration reports arrived. Another 956 individuals’ reported deaths should have been investigated to determine whether they were truly deceased; if so, their benefits should have been terminated. In all instances, an automated system “should have generated alerts to notify the appropriate field office to take action and resolve the discrepancies,” but that happened only about 20 percent of the time. In addition, in almost three-fourths of the cases, auxiliary beneficiaries continued to receive benefits that they would have been denied had the SSA’s systems propagated the death entries for the primary beneficiaries onto the records for the auxiliary beneficiaries.

OIG made three recommendations to the SSA. First, the agency should resolve the discrepancies with the potentially deceased individuals that OIG discovered are still receiving benefits. Second, it should consider enhancing its systems to ensure that death entries are propagated from primary beneficiaries’ records to auxiliary beneficiaries’ records. Third, it should implement procedures “to periodically identify and review instances where individuals with a death entry on the Numident continue to receive payments.”

The SSA agreed with the recommendations, but that offers little comfort to taxpayers. The agency also agreed to implement similar measures after a 2009 audit, yet 91 possibly deceased individuals identified at that time continue to receive payments despite ongoing discrepancies in their records, OIG observed in its latest report. Last year, OIG also discovered that the SSA was disbursing Social Security benefits to individuals whose Medicare benefits it had terminated due to death.

Reform of the SSA, as with most other government agencies, is unlikely. After all, when one is spending other people’s money, why put forth the effort necessary to ensure that the money is spent wisely? Like many of those still receiving Social Security benefits, OIG’s report might as well be declared dead on arrival.

Animal welfare campaigners are calling on Nicola Sturgeon's army of MPs to oppose the Conservative move during a Commons vote this week. The matter is devolved and the sport was made illegal north of the Border in 2002 and while Nationalist MPs have traditionally refrained from voting on issues which do not affect Scotland, their position on this issue remains unclear. Any intervention from the 56 parliamentarians could prove crucial, with Labour and a number of Tories prepared to vote against the proposed changes to the Hunting Act 2004. Since their election in May, the SNP politicians sitting in Westminster have been inundated with letters, emails and calls urging them to take part in the vote. But, with just days ahead of Wednesday's vote, animal welfare charities have ramped up the pressure in a last-ditch attempt to secure the SNP vote. Animal Concern's John Robins said he and a number of other campaigners have bombarded the politicians with letters in the past week.

This is an important moral issue and it is above party politics and national borders John Robins

He added: ""Make no mistake, without action from SNP MPs this Wednesday, the full horror of fox hunting will return to the English shires by the end of the summer. ""This is an important moral issue and it is above party politics and national borders.” Scotland was the first part of the UK to ban hunting with dogs 13 years ago followed by England and Wales two years later. Mr Robins described the ban in Scotland as being ""ineffective"", claiming the blood sport is not properly policed north of the Border. In a letter to the MPs, Mr Robins said: ""I urge all of you to attend the debate on Wednesday and vote against the proposed amendments.

Here are some photographs of Benediction following Solemn Mass last Sunday at St Sebastian’s Church in Salzburg. The celebrant was Fr Daniel Kretschmar F.S.S.P.

During the Mass, after the Elevation, the choir sang the Christmas hymn ‘Christe redemptor omnium’ which is surely one of the most beautiful melodies in the entire Gregorian repertory. The niche in the centre of the Altar revolves to one of three positions, exposing separately the Tabernacle, Crucifix or Monstrance. In these photos you can see the latter two ‘settings’. Outside the church in its famous cemetery lie the remains of Mozart’s widow Constanza (who remarried hence the name Nissen) and his father Leopold.

Continuing the Austrian theme, a reader has sent in a link to the video below of Pontifical Mass at St Peter’s celebrated by Pope John Paul II on the Feast of SS Peter & Paul in 1985. The most incredible musical forces were assembled: the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and the Vienna Singverein, along with soloists Kathleen Battle, Trudeliese Schmidt, Ferruccio Furlanetto and Gosta Winbergh, conducted by the legendary Herbert von Karajan. They performed Mozart’s Coronation Mass complete: Kyrie (3.32), Gloria (7.02), Credo (16.16), Sanctus (29.36), Agnus Dei (40.36) and also Mozart’s ‘Ave verum’ (48.24). And not to be outdone, the Sistine Choir is on good form too, singing a beautiful rendition of Bartolucci’s ‘O sacrum convivium’ after the dismissal (53.36) during which Pope John Paul goes over to thank the Austrian maestro (53.58). The Deacon chants the Gospel exquisitely too (12.17).",2017-11-27T01:14:08.7454,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,Benediction in Salzburg and the Vienna Philharmonic at Papal Mass,New Liturgical Movement,,[''],,,,

This Friday started out with the message that popular vote loser Donald Trump was reaching out to the House maniacs and was willing to go where they needed to go on Trumpcare, and that meant killing Obamacare's Medicaid expansion as soon as this year. That kind of freaked out House leadership and apparently they got their message back to the White House—because now the White House is back on board with the original, slower plan.

After President Trump met at the White House with the House GOP leaders, his chief spokesman said the president fully supports the bill’s timeline for phasing out the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, which some on the right would like to accelerate. Earlier in the day, the House leaders dismissed the idea of speeding up. “Right now the date that’s in the bill is what the president supports,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, adding: “It’s not a question of negotiation.” Addressing the suggestion from some conservative members that their proposed Medicaid expansion phaseout be moved up to begin in 2018 instead of 2020, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said at a news conference on Capitol Hill: “I think right now that would be very difficult to do.”

Remember that story from back during the campaign that made headlines for a day? It was this line: ""Trump tends to echo the words of whomever last spoke to him, making direct access to him even more valuable, the people said, requesting anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussions.""

UK Daily Mail





By James Wilkinson









Apollo astronauts who orbited the moon two months before Neil Armstrong's famous 1969 landing heard mysterious and unexplainable 'music' on its far side, out of the range of Earthly radio transmissions, it has emerged.





Recently unearthed recordings made by NASA of the journey, which took the Apollo 10 capsule around the far side of the moon, show the astronauts reacting with surprise and confusion to an unearthly howling noise in their headsets.

The sound began once the capsule was on an hour-long trip around the far side of the moon, out of the range of any Earth broadcast. At one point the baffled astronauts can be heard discussing whether they should tell NASA command or not.

'You hear that? That whistling sound? Whooooooooo!' one of them says.





Another astronaut says he can: 'It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music.'

'Well, that sure is weird music,' his companion agrees.





And no, the 'music' was nothing to do with Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, which was released four years later.





The sounds lasted almost the whole hour that the capsule was on the far side of the moon, and back on Earth the recording was shelved by NASA until 2008, when it was declassified. Now it has resurfaced in the upcoming third season of Science Channel's series, NASA's Unexplained Files.

February 12, 2015 (MercatorNet.com) -- One of the last places in the world you would expect to have many large families is Germany. German women have, on average, only 1.4 children each, and one in five women will remain childless. Chancellor Angela Merkel is one of those. By contrast, one of her chief ministers, Ursula von der Leyen, has seven children.

Probably there are not many families of that size in the country, but there are a substantial number with three or more -- about 1.4 million, making up 12 percent of all families with children, according to this infographic on the website of the German Association of Large Families (KRFD). And remember, three kids qualifies as a “large family” these days.

With the country’s population declining in recent years – in spite of immigration, which the native Germans are getting somewhat restless about anyway – you would think the nation would be grateful to those couples slowing down that process by having three or more kids. But is it?

No. Not judging by the amount of space they get in the news media, and the kind of treatment they get when they are mentioned. Stereotypes and clichés are the order of the day, according to a recent study carried out by a group of researchers from Cologne. After an exhaustive analysis of 1,100 articles mentioning families published by German newspapers in 2011 and 2012, they entitled their report, “The Last of the Politicians’ Interests”.

The research, led by Professor of Journalism Marlis Prinzing (Macromedia analysis Hochschule fuer Medien und Kommunikation), was commissioned by the KRFD and financed by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women, and Children, which started offering family subsidies several years ago to encourage higher fertility.

It turns out that German media just don’t get it. If they mention large families it is only to point out the problems some of them have: financial burdens, family conflict and insecure housing for example. Cliches suggesting that “families with many children are abnormal” or “only families with immigrant parents have many children” are trotted out.

In larger families the mother is more likely to stay at home while the father goes out to work. In 41 percent of the articles examined this traditional model was presented in a negative light – partly on the assumption that the mother only has a couple of children to look after. The needs of the larger family in terms of a home-maker was simply overlooked.

Again, while news about the family in general was mostly related to politics, those concerning large families were always presented in relation to specific and problematic cases.

In general, the topic of family and of the number of children was treated in a reductive way, giving space only to opinions that were based on commonplaces and stereotypes, which in turn were often supported by the voices of so called “experts.” Daily papers in particular seldom give a voice to the real protagonists.

More often, though, German journalists simply avert their eyes. In just under 60 percent of the examined articles in fact, the existence of many children was commented on neither positively nor negatively. They were treated as devoid of public relevance, unless they were in trouble.

Further, any articles about large families that did appear were predominantly written by women, though there is an equal representation of both sexes in the newsrooms. Moreover, when the topic concerned public policy regarding the family, authors were equally represented among men and women.

Regional papers, the research showed, are much more likely to write about large families.

It is evident that white middleclass values predominate in the national German media – as elsewhere in the developed world – and that large families are associated with an immigrant class whose values are somewhat alien and not to be encouraged.

But journalists need to wake up to their country’s need of larger families, go looking for families that break class barriers and popular stereotypes, and find out what makes them tick. With a mother of seven holding a top government post (and Ursula van der Leyen even had a “real job” before all that – she is a doctor) they have a very respectable reason to do so.

6507,3112752.0,conservativehq.com,bias,http://www.conservativehq.com/print/23633,"The most misunderstood and misreported story of the 2016 Republican National Convention is undoubtedly the Monday floor fight over whether or not there would be a roll call vote on the new Rules for the Republican National Committee.

Most of the media, and many if not most Trump delegates, seem convinced that the fight was all about “unbinding” delegates bound to vote for Trump by virtue of his primary vote.

The reality is that the impetus behind the efforts of Virginia’s National Committeeman Morton Blackwell and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli had nothing to do with the #NeverTrump effort to “unbind” delegates bound to Donald Trump – it was all about reforms to the Rules to return control of the RNC back to the state party organizations and grassroots Republican precinct officials that Blackwell has been working on for years.

And perhaps most importantly it was about rolling back anti-grassroots amendments to the Rules that incumbent RNC Chairman Reince Priebus championed that would all but institutionalize him and his cronies as the unaccountable masters of the national infrastructure of the GOP.

Among the Rules changes voted in without a roll call was one that allows the Chairman of the RNC to appoint members to committees and keep their names and contact information secret.

Much needed financial accountability was also defeated as were proposals to incentivize state GOP organizations to build the Party by granting, in the future, bonus delegate allocations to states with closed primaries.

None of these proposals had anything to do with unbinding Trump delegates.

Blackwell also championed proposals to rollback undemocratic Rules put in place by the Romney organization at the 2012 convention, Rules that allow presidential campaigns to, in essence, “fire” duly elected delegates they don’t like and replace them with individuals of their own choosing; allow changes to the Republican Party Rules between Conventions, without a vote of delegates elected by the grassroots of the Party; and undo the rules regarding the primary calendar that were designed to stop the trend toward front-loading the primary season and preserve the opportunity for Republicans across the country to have a say in who their presidential candidate would be.

None of those sensible proposals had anything to do with “unbinding” Trump delegates to the 2016 Republican National Committee – indeed it arguable that those Rules were major impediments to the on the ground state-by-state success of the grassroots populist rebellion that power the Trump campaign.

And they are matters that Blackwell had been working on for four years – during and after the 2012 Republican National Convention.

These proposals were intended to forestall a repeat of 2012 where the RNC and some state GOP Committees unilaterally changed or disregarded the Rules to award Mitt Romney disproportionate shares of their delegates.

However, in a move that was an entirely predictable tactic, the #NeverTrump cabal tried to piggyback onto Blackwell’s reform package their plan to disrupt Trump’s nomination – and the professional political class insiders at the RNC were only too happy to encourage that and use it to convince Trump delegates that a roll call on any Rules package beside the one proposed by Chairman Priebus could open the door to “unbinding” Trump’s delegates.

And so practically every picture of Morton Blackwell or Ken Cuccinelli pressing the case for reform of the RNC had a vocal #NeverTrumper in the background or lined-up at the mike demanding a roll call for entirely different and mutually exclusive reasons.

And the insiders at the RNC were only too happy to stall (by hiding behind armed guards according to some reports) and according to others on the receiving end, lie and threaten delegates to get them to pull their signatures from the petitions necessary to force a roll call vote on the reform package. (a majority of 7 states was required, at one point the reform forces claimed a majority in 9).

The reality is that by defeating Blackwell’s reform package the Trump delegates made the Republican National Committee and the state party organizations considerably less democratic, open and transparent and made the rise of another populist candidate like Trump that much more difficult – if not impossible.

It is understandable why the leadership level of the Trump campaign wanted the whole reform issue to go away – their goal is a smooth convention that showcases their message. The problem is, the Republican National Convention Rules process is the traditional and most democratic way to formulate the Party Rules and in the past, such as in 1980, where there were also deep divisions in the GOP wise men and women met behind closed doors to try to work out a way to build the Republican coalition.

That wisdom no longer exists in the professional political class of the GOP where it is now all about the money and the power – electing the candidate and governing America according to Republican principles is merely incidental since they get paid win or lose.

As the 2016 presidential campaign proceeds one issue – the Rules of the Republican Party – that might very well have considerable impact on the future of our constitutional republic will never be debated between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Strange Bedfellows: How Trump and #NeverTrump Defeated Long Overdue Reform Of The RNC,,,[''],,"2020 Election, establishment, Morton Blackwell, Reince Priebus, Rules Committee, Ted Cruz, election reform, Cleveland, Ken Cuccinelli, grassroots, Republican convention, Mike Lee, Paul Ryan",,

Excuse me if I do not partake in all of the celebration of The 50th Anniversary of The Pill because from my perspective it is still very much a reminder of the exploitation and violation of human rights among Puerto Ricans (and Haitians, and working class women in general) that continues today. Ignoring this reality is easy. Yet, it is a part of my, our history that I can’t simply forget or overlook. If I choose to ignore this history I also choose to ignore the history of activism by members of my community that has helped to create change at an institutional level. Ignoring this reality and history also perpetuates the ideas that historically oppressed communities are not important in the work we do today.

There are some things I’m not ready to ignore or forge and many of those are the power of language. The adjectives used to describe members of my community are horrifying. I don’t care if it was how people spoke ""in that time,"" they were and remain inappropriate. To describe our homeland as ""slums,"" ""jungles,"" and our community as ""undesirable,"" ""genetically inferior,"" and ""ignorant"" is defendable? The ideology ""that the poor, uneducated, women of Puerto Rico could follow the Pill regimen, then women anywhere in the world could too"" is not condescending to you? Don’t be fooled. There was almost nothing that was ""female controlled"" or ""empowering"" about being a part of the trial for many participants, especially after they realized they were taking a medication that they did not know was not approved.

I remember reading the book Sexual Chemistry: A History of the Contraceptive Pill over a decade ago when I was in graduate school. The conversation we had as a group about the book shocked me. While I was sickened by the overt ethnocentrism, classism, ableism, xenophobia, and racism, other classmates were mostly intrigued by what the history was in the US. It was an extremely painful book for me to discuss with a group of 99 percent White people who viewed the history of my community as less than and Othered as fascinating. When I realized a yam in Mexico was a part of the early production of the pill and how the US obtained it, the inclusion of animal products that included pork and how some communities do not consume this product for various reasons, I was floored. Some classmates rolled their eyes at me as if I was making something out of nothing. To this day I’m surprised those people are now working within my community. I hope they have learned something over these ten years about the ways their thought processes isolated the people in the community they now try to provide services to. Engaging in these conversations continue to hurt.

Often, when I bring up this topic, I have people who say to me ""but that was the ‘norm’ back then."" Just because it was/is the ""norm"" does not automatically make it ""right."" Others have said to me ""Look at how many people and families the pill as helped."" As if the lives of the women who were injured, died, or experienced some major side effects during the trials makes that ok. Who is thanking them? Who is remembering them? Then there are the ""We need more of a biomedical model and not just a social one."" I don’t disagree, I just think that a biomedical model can also recognize how the field is constructed and given value by a society that gives it value (and money). I also think a biomedical model can be one that does not completely ignore a community response. Just because it has more money behind it does not make it better than other models.

On anniversaries such as these, I ask that we all take a moment and think about the people who have been directly impacted negatively during trials, especially when historically discussions are not comprehensive and exclude us. Also think about how pharmaceutical companies are still engaging in some questionable actions and continue to purchase land in Puerto Rico, which does bring jobs to the island, yet those jobs are not always permanent.

All these talks about Puerto Rico and our status, do people really think that big money corporations want to lose the ability to work in a ""foreign"" country with a completely different approach to taxes? Think about it and consider doing some research on your own.",2017-11-27T01:14:21.395055,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Why I'm Not Celebrating the Pill,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

(Before It's News)

Asking for “Gun Control” in America is like asking for “Freedom From Religion” in Iran

This is a follow-up to my last post…

http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2012/12/our-children-are-paying-the-ultimate-price-2515154.html

Just as I expected the cry for gun control has rebounded. But I wonder how many people actually realize what the removal of guns really entails. Let me paint that picture for you if I may.

A presidential decree goes out that every citizen must turn in their guns whether they have a permit for them or not. Only the military and other licensed and authorized personnel may carry guns now. This is an issue not because Americans love their guns so much… but because America has become a place one need a gun in order to feel that they are playing on ”even ground”.

So a decree goes out in every citizen must turn in their weapons. Some comply and others become irate when they find that they are not even going to be compensated for their loss after complying. But all too many choose not to comply at all and here is where the trouble starts.

A presidential declaration is issued that if Americans will not turn their guns over voluntarily that the government will go door to door and remove them by force if needed. I wonder what kind of trouble this would cause with our already riled population?

People have started thinking that Americans value their gun rights over the lives of their children and this is just not true. The fact is that America has become one of the most dangerous places to live in the world with gun possession among criminals being the highest of those who actually own a gun.

Simply put when the government starts talking about those “criminal” factions refused to give up their guns they’re not talking about actual criminals they’re talking about us patriots who know that once we give up our guns the criminal faction and Obama’s military will be the only ones left armed.

So when Sam starts knocking at doors asking if you have any guns I doubt that they will take your word for it that you don’t… Every house will be searched and every secret uncovered by them. Many people will be taken to jail that day and it won’t be for gun possession but other thins they find that they deamed a threat.

There’s been a lot of hype about the FEMA camps lately some of which Sandy victims still live in today. The notion of NWO being tied to the 600 some FEMA camps around the United States all of which are repaired…staffed and ready for occupants is no fiction!… Who do you think those occupants will be? Those they arrest during the gun hunt of course. It seems they’ve been preparing for this for a very long time.

Heck they even have other countries involved.

And speaking of other countries being involved… Where does China get off thinking it has anything to say about American gun control?

In what becomes of those who are then left weaponless? I do not think it is too far of a stretch of the imagination to think that …the true criminals out there, those who think nothing of us…will find a way of keep their guns because they somehow feel uncompelled toward following the law like the rest of us.

As a criminal it would look like all “pray” had suddenly lost its teeth… a real reason to rejoice indeed.

It is sad folks but I think that what we’re looking forward to in our near future is a civil war that eventually blossoms into the catalyst that destroys America. Call it history repeating itself or the Bible revealing itself… anything you like… But for God’s sake don’t just disregard it simply because it is too difficult to look straight in the eye.

Prince William made a dosa - similar to a crepe - using an automatic machine invented by a company from Bangalore, and declared the result delicious.



Kate, however, was rather less adventurous, politely declining the chance to taste her husband’s culinary efforts.



On the second day of their week-long tour of India and neighbouring Bhutan, the Duke and Duchess visited The Social, a cafe and business centre used as a meeting place by Mumbai’s young innovators.



Kate, wearing a cream dress by Emilia Wickstead, joined her husband on a stand for Mukunda Foods, established three years ago by its chief executive Eshwar Vikas, 24.

PA The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive for a UK Government Great campaign event

He showed the couple the dosamatic machine, his own invention. It makes pancakes, crepes, dosas and omelettes automatically after being loaded with batter. The machine even has a smartphone app linked to your alarm so you can have freshly-made food waiting when you get out of bed.



William, 33, poured batter onto the hotplate of the machine and waited while it cooked and rolled up the crisp dosa and pushed it onto a plate.



He took a small bite from one end and told Mr Vikas it tasted good, before offering the Duchess a bite. She politely waved the food away with her hand.



William may not be a fan of spicy food but it appears he loves dosas.







PA The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tuck into the Indian cooking

Mr Vikas said: “The Duke told me he and the Duchess love dosas and he said it was a wonderful machine.



“He said they would love to have one in their palace and the Duchess said that because you can also use it to make pancakes the whole of London will want one.”



The couple were also introduced to the team behind Mahindra Racing, an Indian-backed motor racing team that competes in the Formula E championship for F1-style electric cars.



William, who lives racing his motorcycle, sat in a racing car simulator and grinned as he drove around the virtual Buddh International circuit in Delhi, managing a lap time of 2mins 6secs.





PA Kate smiles as she is shown the work of the young entrepreneurs

Isaias Sousa Valero, one of the team’s technicians, said: “It’s a good lap time. He is a really nice driver and he could come and drive for us anytime with a bit more training.”



The couple were also shown a Braille typing machine made by another local company, and each wore a blindfold as they tried their hand at typing letters by following instructions on which combinations of keys to press. They spelled the word George.



Before they left, the Duke made a short speech to launch an awards programme called the Tech Rocketship Awards. As he made his way to a lectern, he quietly asked his wife “do you want to do it?”. She laughed and said no.



The Duke began by putting his hands together in the traditional Indian greeting, and said “Namaste Mumbai!” meaning hello Mumbai.

That's right, Ryan — according to a story on AmmoLand News and again on rollcall.com yesterday, “House Plans Vote on Guns Next Week” — will urge the U.S. House early next week to vote for “a counterterrorism package that will include a provision to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns” and a so-called mental health bill that will effectively disarm and prohibit gun ownership for millions of Americans without due process based on phony junk science and the “diagnoses” from any anti-gun doctor with an axe to grind.

Of course, these politicians — people who have made a career out of habitual lies and broken promises — are trying to reassure gun owners that they will build in an appeals process for anyone wrongly placed on the government's East-German Stasi-style secret watchlists.

Yeah, right.

As our friends at Gun Owners of America points out here, even IF there is an appeals process for being wrongly placed on a watchlist (as millions of Americans are) no one will be able to afford the attorneys' fees to fight that legal battle.

Sadly, the institutional gun lobby is offering a so-called “compromise” which will arguably be just as bad as the anti-gunners' bill … all in an attempt to try to look ‘reasonable.'

You and I know that's a very, very bad strategy: like trying to feed scraps of meat to the crocodile that's about to eat you.

Anti-gun bills being introduced include:

Obama’s “No-Fly, No Guns” program, labeling you a “terrorist” because some bureaucrat doesn’t like your political views.

Implement mental health gun ban, so any hand-picked “doctor” can declare you mentally unfit to own firearms … with no due process or right to appeal.

Again, this attack on our firearm freedom will be launched right after politicians return from the July 4th 2016 recess — so after getting rested up during a weekend of phony homage to freedom, they will turn right around next week and attack your freedom.

So PLEASE take this threat seriously. Sign the online NO WATCHLIST GUN BAN petition.

Equally important, consider a pro-gun gift of $$100, $$250, $$500 or more … if you can.

The more funding Wisconsin Gun Owners has available, the more we can do RIGHT NOW to hold our Wisconsin congressional delegation accountable.

Corey Graff

Executive Director

P.S. – Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, lead by notorious compromiser Paul Ryan, is cutting a deal with the democrat gun controllers to ran into law a massive nationwide gun ban targeting millions of unsuspecting Americans who should NOT be on any government watchlist. This major SELL-OUT being hatched between Washington neocon republicans and the democrat gun banners will be the largest gun control package — and the most insidious — passed in years.

Please sign the enclosed NO WATCHLIST GUN BAN petition and consider a pro-gun gift to WGO: $$25, $$50, $$100 or more will make a big difference.

99,118.0,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/youtube-star-claims-because-hotel-said-no-to-free-stay-shes-being-bullied-owner-responds/,"A 22-year-old British vlogger has made a name for herself by promoting products and places on social media. She uses her face to gain followers and helps other places sell their products by sharing them with her countless fans.

So when this vlogger, Elle Darby, approached the owner of Charleville Lodge Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, she asked the hotel owner to allow her to stay at the hotel for FREE. And she said that if she got a free room, she’d promote the Dublin hotel on her social media page and help get it even more business.

But the owner laughed at her request. The owner, Paul Stenson, hit the social media star with scorn and shared the email he wrote back to her online, so everyone could see what he actually said.

In response, the YouTube star posted a video claiming that the hotel bullied her.

Because she wanted to establish a “possible collaboration” with the hotel and get to stay there for free for herself and her partner, the hotel denied her entitled request.

“I would love to feature you in my Youtube videos/dedicated Instagram stories/posts to bring traffic to your hotel and recommend others to book up in return for free accommodation,” she wrote.

But the hotel owner thought her request was ludicrous. Stenson poured scorn back into the online exchange and has since banned the bloggers from his hotel.

Darby, who is based in Bath, Somerset, told the hotel owner that she had 87,000 YouTube subscribers and 76,000 Instagram followers. And she does “work as a social media influencer, mainly lifestyle, beauty & travel based.”

Stenson thought her request was insane and her line of work lacked “self-respect and dignity.”

He wrote:

“Thank you for your email looking for free accommodation in return for exposure. It takes a lot of balls to send an email like that if not much self-respect and dignity. If I let you stay here in return for a feature in your video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you? Who is going to pay the housekeepers who clean your room?”

He then wrote:

“The waiters who serve you breakfast? The receptionist who checks you in? Who is going to pay for the light and heat you use during your stay? The laundering of your bed sheets? The water rates? Maybe I should tell my staff they will be featured in your video in lieu of receiving payment for work carried out while you’re in residence?”

Because the YouTube star hit back with a complaint on video, her fans also joined the fray. Some accused Stenson of bullying, while other said Darby was a “spoiled brat.”

In her video, she said:

“I feel disgusting having to say this. As a 22-year-old girl, who’s running her own business from her home, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. These were all 30 years plus people internet bullying a 22-year-old girl who is just trying to run her own business and raise awareness of what appeared to be a stunning Dublin hotel.”

The plain has been a continually fought-over strategic link between the north of the country and Kabul during decades of war, dominated by different Afghan factions at various stages.

Just a few years ago, the region experienced surprising gains in prosperity and security, driven in part by commerce around the massive air base and by NATO’s desire to keep the region stable. The area is important because of the airfield and because the main road that passes north through Bagram and the Salang Tunnel, and eventually into Uzbekistan, is an indispensable resupply corridor.

But in the past few years some gains have deteriorated, with the Taliban and the militant group Hezb-i-Islami gaining strength in Parwan, the province where the base is.

Parwan’s police chief, Gen. Akram Khan Behzad, blamed Taliban militants for the recurring rocket fire; they use the dense trees outside the base to evade capture. “We have not been able to clear up the area from insurgent activity because we lack the personnel,” he said.

NATO officials said they did not know what weapons had been used in the attack or from how far away they had been fired. But the Afghan police chief for Bagram district, Alhaj Ezmarai Nasiri, said the rockets were most likely from a BM-12 launcher or similar model, which has a 12-tube array and can fire 107-millimeter rockets five miles. Insurgents have been known to strip off and use just one rocket tube, which can be carried in a car trunk.

The attack came after General Dempsey met senior American and Afghan leaders to discuss the growing crisis in which Afghan police officers and soldiers were gunning down American and NATO troops in so-called green-on-blue or insider attacks. NATO officials worry that the killings — 40 American and NATO troops have died from such attacks this year — could undermine the exit strategy of steadily training and turning over security to Afghan forces during the next two years, before a near-total withdrawal of Western military forces.

President Obama also said he would confer with President Hamid Karzai to express his concern about the killings. And there were signs on Tuesday that American pressure might be having an effect: The police chief of Kandahar Province fired the district police chief of Spinbaldak, a town bordering Pakistan, for failing to prevent an Afghan national policeman from killing an American soldier on Sunday in the most recent fatal green-on-blue episode.

But it was not clear whether the firing truly signaled plans to get more serious: Jawed Faisal, the spokesman for the Kandahar governor, said, “Any security official who fails to prevent such attacks will be sacked.” But he acknowledged that no one had been fired in Zhare, a district of Kandahar where another green-on-blue shooting wounded two American soldiers on Friday; he said that investigation had not been completed.",2018-02-11 00:46:19.991119,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Rocket Fire Damages Plane Used by Joint Chiefs Chairman,"Richard A.

(Before It's News)

When it comes to monetization there are a lot of things that you should know. Being that most people use Google Adsense to start making money online, it is a good idea to know when the best time to place Ads on your blog would be.

If you are creating a niche site, then I would place Adsense ads on the site right when the site goes live. For personal blogs, such as this one you should do things differently. With a personal blog you have to worry about your readers and their preference before you even think about making money with your blog.

So when is the best time to monetize a blog?

When you have 50 blog posts

If you have more than 50 blog posts live on your blog, then it is about time that you put some ads on it. The reason why you should wait until you have more than 50 blog posts is because you don’t want your blog to look empty when you add advertisements to it. A lot of people do this and readers don’t like this.

4 months after going live

Another time to place ads on your blog is after four months of going live. The reason why I highly recommend waiting at least 4 months is because by then you should have at least a small following and you should have enough blog posts to fill up your site. Some bloggers out there will recommend only waiting 3 months but I have found that after 3 months you are still not where you want to be with traffic and if the traffic isn’t there then there is no point to place ads on the site just yet.

100 unique visitors per day

When you get 100 unique visitors to your blog every day then that is a great time to place ads on your site. The reason I say this is because 100 unique visitors will mean that you should make some money from Google Adsense every day. Not only that but 100 unique visitors is where most blogs will stay for the remainder of their existence so if you don’t place ads on your site now, then you may not ever do it.

100 email subscribers

Do you have 100 email subscribers yet? If you have more than 100 email subscribers, then it is time to monetize your blog. With 100 email subscribers you should be able to send out an email and get at least 20 of those subscribers to come to your blog. This is a benchmark that I use because email subscribers are much more reliable than general traffic you get from the search engines or social media.

1000 cumulative fans/followers on Facebook and Twitter

The last thing that I would recommend is to go by your fans/followers on Facebook and Twitter. The reason I recommend going off of these is because getting a decent following on both of these sites could mean residual traffic month after month. With social media being the new hotspot for traffic you can’t ignore what you have. If your new blog doesn’t meet any of the requirements above but you do have more than 1000 cumulative fans/followers on Facebook and Twitter, then it is a good time to monetize your blog. Just remember, these have to be actual blog readers, not just a bunch of your friends.

When it comes to monetization you need think about the following you have as opposed to the money you could be making. The problem that most new blogs have is they try way too hard to earn money online. If you want to have a successful blog, then you will need to prove to your readers that you care about them more than you do your own wellbeing.

102,122.0,blackagendareport.com,unreliable,https://blackagendareport.com/puerto-rico-homeowners-brace-another-disaster-foreclosures,"Puerto Rico Homeowners Brace for Another Disaster: Foreclosures

“Maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes.”

Lenders to Puerto Rican homeowners have kicked foreclosures into high gear in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, skirting local and federal borrower protections. According to attorneys and experts, lenders have ignored federal moratoria on foreclosures; placed notices of default in newspapers where they’re unlikely to be seen; sent files to homeowners in English rather than Spanish; and required residents to complete tasks that are borderline impossible without electrical power yet fully restored, among other abuses.

The foreclosure horrors add to Puerto Rico’s Dickensian experience of late. Close to 35 percent of the island remains without power after Hurricane Maria, with full restoration not expected until May. At least 100,000 people have left the island. Abandoned pets are everywhere. Government services have been slashed or hobbled. Even one major proposed solution, wiping out Puerto Rico’s debt, will take a personal cost: The bonds represent the life savings of many residents to whom the financial products were aggressively marketed without explanation of the downsides.

“The economy of the island could collapse, as the Republican tax bill imposes a 20 percent tax on offshore exports.”

Ultimately, the expected wave of foreclosures could prove worse than what happened in the most hard-hit areas in the U.S. mainland during the Great Recession. According to the New York Times, roughly one-third of 425,000 Puerto Rican homeowners have fallen behind on mortgage payments, and with jobs scarce after the hurricane, that number will likely grow. In fact, the economy of the island could collapse, as the Republican tax bill imposes a 20 percent tax on offshore exports — a category that includes Puerto Rican manufacturing.

But if you think America learned lessons from the orgy of illegality that accompanied foreclosures in the United States after 2008, just look to Puerto Rico. Despite new rules to prevent foreclosure fraud, Puerto Rico appears to be Exhibit A in its continuation — and it’s only just beginning.

Foreclosures ravaged Puerto Rico even before Maria, up 130 percent in 2016 relative to a decade before. Adding two hurricanes to the equation makes the island’s residents ripe for a gargantuan ripoff.

The foreclosure process in Puerto Rico resembles the judicial foreclosure process on the mainland. Lenders must follow federal guidelines on notifying borrowers of default and giving them an opportunity to cure debt. Then lenders can file a lawsuit for foreclosure. Judges are obligated to impose mandatory mediation, bringing borrowers and lenders to the table to work out a resolution. Only if that doesn’t work can lenders obtain a judgment and evict the homeowner.

“The expected wave of foreclosures could prove worse than what happened in the most hard-hit areas in the U.S. mainland during the Great Recession.”

However, what sound like substantive protections for the borrower often don’t play out that way. “Many times they don’t know about their rights,” said Veronica Rivera, a coordinator for Derecho a tu Casa or Right to Your House — a coalition of legal aid groups providing information and assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure. “They think that the bank would understand that they can’t pay because they lost their jobs. It surprises me sometimes how much trust people have in the banks.”

For example, after Hurricane Maria, the federal government imposed a foreclosure moratorium on homes either backed by government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or those with Federal Housing Administration insurance. The FHA moratorium was recently extended to March 19, 2018, but it only applies to a sliver of loans. The Fannie and Freddie moratoria were set to expire on December 31, but the lenders made an extension until March 31. Banks and mortgage investors voluntarily offered three months of relief from payments, but homeowners had to call their lender to trigger it. “The banks said you have to call,” said Rivera. “We didn’t have internet for more than a month, didn’t have electricity, no communication. Many didn’t know.”

Indeed, a report from the public interest firm Hedge Clippers shows that one company, Roosevelt Cayman Asset Co., has 289 active foreclosure cases in federal court and another 56 in local Puerto Rican courts. Federal courts, typically not a venue for foreclosure cases, are seen as faster than local courts, so offshore companies like Roosevelt lean heavily on them.

“They think that the bank would understand that they can’t pay because they lost their jobs.”

Even after the hurricane, Roosevelt has filed motions for default judgment or eviction in the cases. The Intercept has reviewed lists of dozens of these motions. For example, Roosevelt filed a motion for eviction of Ernesto Santiago-Guzman and his family on October 11, three weeks after Maria hit, and a motion for default judgment against Elias Rivera-Rivera on October 12. U.S. District Judge Gustavo Gelpí denied that request because the case was only initiated a month before the hurricanes, “which trashed the entire island of Puerto Rico.” The judge postponed the case until March.

Other judges have not been so kind. Docket entries show that Roosevelt secured a default judgment against Carlos Gonzalez-Luna’s property on October 23.

Many of the loans Roosevelt acted on were purchased in a fire sale from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after the 2015 failure of Doral Bank, a lender with a large portfolio of Puerto Rican mortgages. These loans were severely delinquent, some over two years. Federally insured distressed mortgages in Puerto Rico have become an appetizing target for Wall Street land speculators seeking to make a quick buck and turn Puerto Rico into a playground for the rich.

An unidentified Puerto Rico homeowner submitted a comment to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s consumer complaint database, claiming that Roosevelt is “not flexible and expressed that they just want to acquire the home to build their house portfolio.”

“Federally insured distressed mortgages in Puerto Rico have become an appetizing target for Wall Street land speculators.”

Critics allege Roosevelt uses sleazy tactics to get default judgments. “Since the hurricane, they’ve sought to use service by publication, publishing names in the newspaper to serve the lawsuits. Who’s reading the newspaper these days?” asked Jim Baker, founder of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, who helped with the Hedge Clippers report. “Then they ask for default judgment because they served papers and the homeowners haven’t responded. In most cases, they’re getting [the judgment],” he added, referring to Roosevelt.

Roosevelt is an affiliate of Rushmore Loan Management Services, which in turn services loans owned by private equity giant TPG Capital, managers of $73 billion in assets. While TPG spokesperson Patrick Clifford claims only a client relationship between Rushmore and TPG, Rushmore’s principal owners are senior TPG executives. A June 2017 report lists Rushmore as the second-largest repossessor on the island, behind only Banco Popular, Puerto Rico’s main bank.

(A new TPG “impact investing” fund includes on its board Pierre Omidyar, founder of First Look Media, The Intercept’s parent company.)

Activist groups held protests outside TPG headquarters in Manhattan, calling for an end to foreclosures on the island. Related demonstrations were held in eight cities around the world. “This is the first of many companies hurting the people of Puerto Rico and it will be one of many we will be scrutinizing,” said Julio López Varona, a spokesperson for Hedge Clippers, in a statement. “We have asked TPG and Rushmore directly to stop their foreclosures and we will continue to target them until they stop harming Puerto Ricans.”

This appears to have made an impact. Rushmore claims to have “instituted an immediate suspension of foreclosure proceedings in Puerto Rico,” per spokesperson Steven Goldberg, including stopping notice by publication. The length of the freeze is indefinite.

“The foreclosure moratorium expires December 31 for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and by March for FHA-insured loans.”

“Rushmore pursues loan modification or other alternatives to foreclosure first in all cases and remains fully committed to working to keep as many borrowers as possible in their homes,” Goldberg said, “especially in light of the extremely challenging circumstances caused by the hurricane.” He said the company has conducted “extensive outreach efforts” to contact borrowers, given communication problems on the island. Goldberg even provided the number to Rushmore’s Puerto Rico office, (877) 509-8389, and its Spanish and English websites, urging borrowers to contact them to seek a resolution to their situations.

TPG’s Clifford added, “We’ve been in constructive dialogue with various advocacy groups, and we plan to continue having those conversations because they are important.”

Even if homeowners were lucky or savvy enough to fall under the foreclosure moratorium, it expires December 31 for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and by March for FHA-insured loans. Many have called for those to be extended, but no decision has been made.

The voluntary payment moratoria also expire by January. In an opinion piece for Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Dia, Ricardo J. Ramos González, who runs the Legal Aid Clinic at the University of Puerto Rico’s School of Law, warned residents that the payment moratorium merely comprised forbearance, not a cancellation of payments. “Those who accepted the moratorium on payments, could very well face a process of collection and eventual foreclosure of their main home, if they are required to pay three months plus the current term,” González wrote. He endorsed a yearlong moratorium on foreclosures, similar to those instituted in some states during the Great Depression.

When foreclosure notices and letters from lenders come in the mail in Puerto Rico, they are typically in English. But many Puerto Ricans only speak Spanish. Unlike in local courts, federal court filings are similarly in English, putting homeowners at a disadvantage.

“Foreclosure notices and letters from lenders are typically in English, but many Puerto Ricans only speak Spanish.”

Rivera of Derecho a tu Casa claims that lenders have been negotiating loss mitigation with borrowers while also pursuing foreclosure, a scheme known as “dual tracking,” which is supposed to be illegal under federal mortgage servicing laws and local law in Puerto Rico. The mediation process has not assisted borrowers more generally. “Lawyers cannot participate in the process unless the client gives us special power,” said Rivera. Worse, lenders send representatives who are not empowered to make decisions, she explained. “It’s a pro forma process,” said Rivera. “The banks do not have to give a specific option.”

Foreclosure lawyers in Puerto Rico are also finding the same discrepancies in foreclosure processing that roiled the United States after the crisis. This is not surprising, since those errors never really stopped in the United States. Rivera alleges that investors who came in and scooped up distressed mortgages didn’t follow property records procedures. “There have been cases where there is no mortgage. They don’t have the note,” Rivera said.

The endgame of aggressively foreclosing on properties in Puerto Rico — where there is little hope of turning them around to make a profit — is unclear. Offshore lenders “made this investment a couple years ago,” said Baker of Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They’re churning through the portfolio. Maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes.” The insurance payouts also benefit offshore purchasers of distressed mortgages; that alone could turn a profit relative to the small price paid.

Derecho a tu Casa offers resources at its website to educate homeowners and also representation for those who qualify. “Many people get depressed and we want to give them hope,” Rivera said. “I can see the difference when I represent someone.”

Both Mr. Toibin and Mr. Lodge started their projects at approximately the same time, but until the books were written, neither was aware of the other's James, so necessarily there is a heightened sense of competition in the air.

''The Master'' received highly favorable reviews, as has Mr. Hollinghurst's novel ''The Line of Beauty,'' about a contemporary scholar obsessed with James. (Ms. Tennant's ''Felony,'' which was published in 2002, is a mystery about the writing of ''The Aspern Papers.'')

Mr. Toibin and Mr. Lodge are keeping their distance. Mr. Lodge, who lives in Birmingham, has not read Mr. Toibin's book (although his wife has) and does not plan to until his own is published, he said. Because Mr. Lodge's book is not yet available, Mr. Toibin, who lives in Dublin, has no sense of the specific content.

In parallel interviews recently in London, it was clear, however, that their curiosity was piqued.

Although there are striking differences between the books, they are complimentary rather than contradictory. Whenever possible, each shows how people and events in James's life inspired his art. Each holds to the facts of his biography, and the books have the same cast of major characters: James's family and his two significant female friends, his cousin Minny Temple and Constance Fenimore Woolson, both of whom served as models for his characters.

At the heart of both is the most dramatic moment in James's life, the London debacle in 1895 of his play ''Guy Domville.'' Edel says that a stagestruck James decided to ''besiege the theater'' and was crushed.

On opening night, reviewed by four titanic critics (George Bernard Shaw, William Archer, H. G. Wells and Arnold Bennett), James saw Oscar Wilde's ''An Ideal Husband,'' and thoroughly disliked it. Then he returned to his theater for the final curtain. When he was led onstage by his leading actor, he recalled, he was greeted by ''the hoots and jeers and catcalls of the roughs'' in the gallery. After ''Guy Domville'' precipitously closed, the next play in that theater was ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''

Each novelist approaches James from a different vantage. Mr. Toibin's initial response was to the book ''Epistemology of the Closet'' in which Eva Kosofsky Sedgwick suggested that James's entire work was written in code. Mr. Toibin took the opposite view. As he said: ''You can't make a blanket assumption about James's sexuality or his fiction or his life. This was not a game between concealment and disclosure.''

Mr. Lodge said: ''Though James was not strongly sexual, so far as I could see, in either direction he had extraordinary intuition into the sexual life, and the emotions connected with that and with marriage. His portrait of an unhappy marriage in the 'Portrait of a Lady' is astonishing for somebody who was never married.''

Mr. Toibin said: ''At some stage I realized I had a character in my head called Henry James, and he decided to make an imaginative intervention'' in James's story. Similarly Mr. Lodge said he wanted ''to explore imaginatively what it was like to be Henry James.''

Asked what he had learned about James from writing his novel, Mr. Toibin stressed the levels of ambiguity, ''and the ways in which they played themselves out both in the life and in the fiction, the fact that he was in certain ways steely, determined and serious and on the other hand was weak and very very sensitive.''

In his answer Mr. Lodge said that he now had a clearer sense of James's life: ''I've got the chronology hard-wired into my brain. I suppose I see his life as a kind of three act play,'' his apprenticeship, a middle period when he was unable ''to move his career into the major achievements he dreamed of'' and ''the slow recovery from the failure of 'Guy Domville' and the gradual building up into the writing the great novels,'' ''The Wings of the Dove,'' ''The Ambassadors'' and ''The Golden Bowl.''

In each new book a male friend appears conspicuously. With Mr. Toibin it is Oliver Wendell Holmes, staunchly heterosexual, but someone for whom James may have felt an attraction. With Mr. Lodge, it is Gerald Du Maurier, the artist turned novelist (of the best-selling ''Trilby'').

Mr. Lodge's novel began when he was asked to adapt ''Trilby'' for television and discovered that Du Maurier had initially offered the idea for the story to James, who rejected it. ''And then 'Trilby' turned out to be this huge best seller, which is something James never had,'' he said. And in contrast to ''Guy Domville'' the subsequent dramatization of ''Trilby'' was also an enormous success.

''I was interested in James's five-year campaign to conquer the English stage,'' Mr. Lodge said, ''how it collapsed, how it coincided with the extraordinary success of his friend. Then, with the sudden death of Du Maurier, James rededicating himself to the art of fiction.''

Although Mr. Lodge's portrait of James is no less personal, he began his novel from a literary perspective. ''My interest,'' he said, ''was to do with the profession of letters, literary ambition and rivalry and in particular what happens if a novelist goes into the field of writing for performance.''

Near the book's end Mr. Lodge allows himself an authorial aside, reminding that James achieved additional posthumous fame for film, television and theatrical adaptations of his fiction.

Through the years Mr. Toibin and Mr. Lodge have occasionally crossed paths, first in Spain in 1993. Mr. Lodge, already a best-selling novelist, was there making a BBC film. Mr. Toibin was working on a nonfiction book.

One day Mr. Toibin had lunch at a local canteen and sat down at a long table. He immediately recognized the man opposite him as Mr. Lodge, and he asked him, ''What did Chad's family make their fortune from in Henry James's 'The Ambassadors'?''

''No one knows,'' Mr. Lodge said. But both knew the reference. In Mr. Lodge's novel, ''The British Museum is Falling Down,'' a hypothetical answer is provided: chamber pots. Looking back on the episode, Mr. Lodge said, ''One of the many ironies connected with this whole business is that in our very first meeting our conversation included a reference to Henry James.''",2018-02-11 00:38:41.836787,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Golden Bowlful Of Literary Inspiration; Henry James Show Up in Novels,Mel Gussow,,"['HOWARD  RICHARD', 'TOIBIN  COLM', 'JAMES  HENRY', 'LODGE  DAVID', 'BOOKS AND LITERATURE', 'MASTER  THE (BOOK)', 'AUTHOR  AUTHOR (BOOK)']","Article on recent rash of novels about author Henry James; Colm Toibin, author of The Master and David Lodge, whose book, Author, Author, is scheduled for publication in fall, comment on interest in James over last two years; Richard Howard, who has written poems about James, says interest is result of rise of James as literary figure and considerable amount of good biographical work on subject; photos (M)",,,nytimes

The Boston Celtics are traveling out to the west coast to battle it out with their longtime rival LA Lakers. The rivalry dates back to the days of Magic vs. Bird and has only grown with Kobe vs. the Big 3. Now its time to start a new era in the Lakers Celtics rivalry with names like Irving, Tatum, Ball, and Ingram. This is a prove ’em game for the Lakers who are on a hot streak winning two in a row and adding another big W against the C’s could do wonders moving forward. The Celtics are trying to snap out of a funk themselves, and a nice win in LA might do just to trick.

The Boston Celtics (34-13) are currently on a three-game losing streak as they fly into the Staples Center. The Celtics are coming off a four-game home stand where they went 1-3, so this west coast trip will do a lot for how they finish this first half of the season. Boston is lead by Kyrie Irving who’s having himself one heck of season averaging 24.5 points! Al Horford is low key been leading the Celtics in assists, rebounds, and steals per game, both of them are going to have to show up to beat the Lakers.

The Los Angeles Lakers (17-29) are fresh off their second win in a row and 5th straight at home after blowing out the Knicks by 20! The Lakers might be without 2nd overall pick Lonzo Ball for this one; Ball leads the team with 7.1 assists and rebound per game. Lucky for the Lakers they will be with their top two scorers with Kyle Kuzman and Brandon Ingram who are averaging 16.4 and 15.7 points per game respectively. Luke Walton is trying his best to win with an extremely young roster with the only true veteran being Brook Lopez who has brought excellent leadership to the team. The Lakers future is bright, and they want to show the Celtics that they aren’t going to be in the cellar of the league for long.

As the Civil Rights Movement grew, so did the Indian Rights Movement. We were fighting for our civil rights from the perspective of treaty rights. Unlike any other minority in the country, we had a political and legal relationship with the United States government which was on the level of nation-to-nation rather than state rights. The states had always trampled on our rights. That is how they formed, by taking Indian land.

We had always been fighting against extractive industries, whether it was gold, uranium, coal or oil. However, when Raymond Yellow Thunder was killed, it had to do directly with racism and the treatment of Indians. He was dragged into an American Legion club on a Saturday night and became entertainment for the White ranchers and farmers that lived in that area. Three days later he was found beaten to death in the trunk of a car.

For at least a week, no one was charged with his death. His family came to the American Indian Movement in Omaha and told us that they had been to the BIA, the FBI, the US Marshals, and nobody would help them. We took a caravan from Omaha to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Two days later we marched on Gordon and held the town for about two days. They finally brought to trial two brothers, who got two years apiece. In the end, they served a little over a year, for conspiring to kill an Indian person. AIM was in the forefront in fighting racism and bringing to national attention this type of incident where Indian deaths go unpunished.

In 1972 we went to the BIA headquarters. We had developed what we called a 20-point solution paper and went to Washington D.C., where we were supposed to meet with various state delegations to the national congress. When we got there, the government cancelled all of these meetings. We then took over the BIA for about seven days, and nobody missed it! We showed that the BIA was one of the most inefficient bureaucracies in the United States, where 80% of their budget went for administrative costs.

About a year later, we went to Wounded Knee. A delegation of Oglalas came to AIM and asked us to help them in their fight against the corrupt leadership of the tribal government. The district Indians, which included mostly full-blooded Indians, were being discriminated against by the half-breeds in control of the government. This was similar to the puppet governments in Latin America that provided resources and labor for the US. A system of colonialism existed on the reservations.

The traditional leadership decided that we ought to go to Wounded Knee. That was where we wouldn't be alone, we would be with the spirits of our ancestors who were killed in the 1890 massacre. We went to Wounded Knee to make a statement, that we stand on our treaty rights, that we are nations of people, that we have human rights, as well as civil rights.

Dennis Bernstein: Your brother, Russell Means, and Dennis Banks were indicted. What were they accused of? It was a very powerful trial and they were ultimately found not guilty.

- Advertisement -

Bill Means: Actually, over 500 people were charged. I myself was charged with interfering with a federal officer, possession of Molotov cocktails, and various other charges which were all eventually dropped.

Russell and Dennis were tried separately in what were called the ""leadership trials."" They lasted for nine months, longer than any other trial in US history. The judge finally dismissed the case because of FBI misconduct, including coercion of witnesses and illegal wiretapping. A republican judge in South Dakota completely reversed a history of racism in the federal court of South Dakota in finding for the defendants.

Dennis Bernstein: But they somehow figured out a way to put Dennis Banks in prison for 14 months. How did that come about?

Bill Means: That was on state charges, which went back to before Wounded Knee. In the town of Custer, South Dakota, there had been a major demonstration in which several public buildings were burnt to the ground and a confrontation between the police and AIM and the Oglala people following the death of a man called Wesley Bad Heart Bull who was killed in a bar by white ranchers who stabbed him over 27 times. No one was charged. This was in January and Wounded Knee happened in February. Dennis was tried in state court, as opposed to federal court, and he served time in state prison.

Before he was convicted, he was given asylum by Governor Jerry Brown and lived in California for two years before Brown was beaten in the next election, at which time he was exiled to a reservation in New York. He eventually turned himself in, was tried and convicted and served his time. He was convicted of riot and some other charges. When the people in the courtroom refused to stand for the judge, the judge ordered riot police to attack and arrest everyone refusing to stand. And then various other charges were brought, in order to get some sort of conviction.

Dennis Bernstein: What were you standing for at Wounded Knee? That was an amazing moment in the history of indigenous rights. You referred to it as ""a reign of terror.""

- Advertisement -

Bill Means: That was due to the oppression of the FBI, which resulted in the conviction of Leonard Peltier. But before and during Wounded Knee the issue was treaty rights: that the US government didn't have jurisdiction on our reservations. The treaty of 1868 said that ""if there are bad men among us, they will be brought to trial."" In a famous case, the United States finally ""assumed"" jurisdiction over Indians because in the early 1900's we were not citizens of the United States. At Wounded Knee we were bringing up our treaty rights, that we were not under US jurisdiction.

Dennis Bernstein: What exactly was the ""reign of terror""?

Bill Means: After Wounded Knee, the number of FBI agents in western South Dakota went from three to over a hundred. All these FBI agents descended on the Pine Ridge Reservation. They said they were looking for guns and fugitives. They proceeded to terrorize Indian people by breaking down the doors of people's homes, dragging out women and children and the elderly, forcing them to lie on the ground. They did what they wanted with Indian people, as if they were back in the times of Custer when the cavalry was in charge.

118,142.0,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/brain-injury-victim-whos-been-comatose-since-1996-gives-mom-unexplainable-christmas-miracle/,"One of the worst things that a mother can face, is having an ill or severely disabled child. When Joellan Huntley was just 15-years-old, she was in a car accident that left her with a catastrophic brain injury. Having been thrown from a car that swerved to avoid a loose dog running along a road in Centreville, Nova Scotia, Joellan suffered traumatic injuries. In that same accident, her boyfriend and a young girl who was the sister of the driver were killed.

As a result of the crash, Joellan’s family won a $1 million settlement, however; by 2014 the family was in a battle with the province’s Community Services Department, which was on a mission to get the money back for past and future costs of care. The result of the battle was a settlement that gave the family funds for physiotherapy and equipment that would add to Joellan’s quality of life.

Since 1996, her mother, Louise Misner, hasn’t been able to have the luxury of having a conversation of her daughter, and the now 37-year-old has spent most of her life unable to walk or talk and she’s been fed through a tube.

While Joellan was able to make sounds to respond to family members, she was unable to communicate any thoughts…until now. Thanks to technology equipment that she recently received, Joellan is able to communicate with her mom via eye motion cameras and software on an iPad. And the best part is that all of this happened on Christmas day, proving that Christmas miracles really do exist for the Nova Scotia family.

It happened when Louise was visiting Joellan at the Kings Regional Rehabilitation Center in Waterville, Nova Scotia.

What seems like a basic conversation between mother and daughter, turned out to be a miracle. Louise had told Joellan that she liked the Christmas outfit that she was wearing. Joellan then used the technology to find an icon for a long-sleeve shirt to respond to her mom.

“Christmas miracle,” said Louise, who had been longing for this exchange for years. “It was God’s way of telling me that she’s finally achieved what she needed to since the accident.”

According to Joellan’s nurses, she is doing well with the new communication system.

“We had to go through two or three different screens until we found the right one for her and it’s called Eyegaze,” said Louise. “Her eyes focus on the icons to answer questions. I knew she just needed time for technology to catch up with her. When God gives you a child, they are the most precious thing and you never give up on them and you always fight for them.”

We take for granted the simple things that most of us are able to do on a daily basis…like have a conversation with a parent or a child. Unfortunately, there are people who don’t have that privilege. Luckily technology is moving forward at a rapid pace and hopefully, life will only get easier for Joellan and her family. They’ve certainly been through enough already.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Brain Injury Victim Who’s Been Comatose Since 1996 Gives Mom Unexplainable Christmas Miracle,Kate Anslinger,,[''],,,,

Here’s how the Transnistria situation could play out over the next year.

A Russian peacekeeper at the checkpoint near Bender, a town in Transnistria. Photo: RIA Novosti

For a very different take read: ""Revealing the post-Soviet identity complex in Transnistria""



Back in 2012, a high-ranking Russian diplomat noted, “Transnistria could live separately from Moldova only if flying to the moon. And because such a possibility is not yet in sight, Moldova and the Transnistrian region will obviously live together.”

Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, many wonder whether Transnistria can secure Russia’s recognition—perhaps even join it—without making the suggested voyage into space. Two interrelated factors could upset the status quo: the breadth of the ongoing military conflict in Eastern Ukraine and conditions for Transnistrian companies’ entrance to the EU market beyond 2015.

The link between Transnistria and the military situation in Ukraine

Over two decades, Russia claimed that Transnistria should be part of Moldova. This was in tune with Moscow’s strategy to leverage the conflict. Rather than definitively separating the region, Russia strived to re-combine Transnistria with Moldova (e.g., the Primakov memorandum in 1997, the Kozak memorandum in 2003) on the conditions Tiraspol would gain the right to veto Moldova’s domestic and foreign policy decisions. The ultimate goal was legitimization of the Russian military presence and the overall “Transnistria-zation” of Moldova.

In the wake of Crimea’s annexation, speedy “passport-ization” of the population in Transnistria, intensification of Russian military drills in the region and declarations (e.g. those made by Russia’s presidential envoy to Crimea) that Transnistria would one day be a part of Russia all seemed to indicate that the Kremlin’s position is under revision.

Although potentially threatening for Moldova, Russia’s recent discourse and actions in Transnistria are, however, primarily aimed at Ukraine. Continuous sabre rattling in Transnsitria is part of a strategy to spread Ukrainian armed forces as wide as possible along the eastern front. Kremlin also attempts to engage authorities in Kiev in a guessing game as to the direction of any potential surprise military strike.

Moreover, Transnistrian territory is used as a base for mushrooming attempts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine’s Odessa oblast. Still, in the absence of massive escalation in Eastern Ukraine that would open a land corridor to Transnistria, reignited hostilities between Chisinau and Tiraspol would little serve the Kremlin.

On the contrary, in such circumstances, resumption of the Transnistrian conflict would challenge the narrative about the “success story” of the Russian-led peacekeeping mission in the region used by Russian diplomacy to fend off initiatives to internationalize the peacekeeping format.

As long as the conflict in Ukraine is contained to parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, Russia prefers to peddle an alternative track in Moldova, namely, investing in pro-Russia political projects (Socialists or Our Party), which have shown relatively good results during the November 2014 general elections and June 2015 local elections.

Instead of occupation, Russia relies on cost-effective and sanctions-free ways to manage the political process in Moldova from a distance. Should Moldova’s pro-European forces be unable to form the government and deliver on promises soon, Russia’s lever in domestic politics might grow without necessarily using the Transnistrian conflict in its favor.

Alternatively, the eventual proliferation of fighting in Donbas to Ukraine’s south might provide Russia with a tempting military opportunity to “solve” Transnistria’s issue once and for all.

Transnistria’s make or break moment, viewed in economic terms

With military conflict burgeoning in the neighborhood, the economy in shatters (a projected 40 percent budget deficit in 2015) and the upcoming electoral cycle, the Transnistrian leadership is in a delicate position.

On the one hand, it should demonstrate loyalty to Moscow in a bid to extract more dividends necessary to offset economic decay and win support for the re-election campaign in 2016. On the other hand, it needs to avoid embroilment in the military conflict with Ukraine or Moldova that would curtail access to the European market and Moldova proper—the two main destinations for Transnistrian goods.

One way to show loyalty is to scale up reunification with Russian rhetoric, denounce Moldova’s “economic blockade” and decry exclusion from or negative repercussions of Moldova’s EU integration. Often, this discourse is far from reality.

Despite over-cited results of the 2006 “referendum” in Transnistria for independence and subsequent association with Russia (97.2 percent), opinions in the region are not so uniform; they are less ideological and more practical.

To begin with, Russia was not the only state Transnistria wanted to reunite with in the past. For instance, in 2011, during a chill in relations with Moscow, Transnistrian leadership pondered organizing a “referendum” to join Ukraine.

If one were to look at societal attitudes, a public survey conducted by a reputable public opinion research company, IMAS, in 2012, on both banks of the Nistru River will be quite telling.

Accordingly, 32 percent of respondents in Transnistria would vote for joining the EU, with 19 percent undecided. Were Transnistria to have a more pluralistic mass media, opinions would probably be even more balanced on the issue.

Besides referendums and public polls, citizenship in Transnistria also speaks volumes about population preference. Out of 500,000 citizens living in the region, 300,000 hold a Moldovan passport. As of April 2015, around 75,000 of Moldovan passports in Transnistria were biometric (and the number keeps growing), which opens the door for visa-free travel to the EU.

In addition, there are 200,000 Russian and 70,000 Ukrainian passports. Data shows that, besides individual survival tactics, a variety of citizenships reflects the diversity of attitudes towards Transnistria as a project.

Claims of economic suffocation, exclusion or negative spillover from EU integration are also misplaced. Otherwise, why would Moldova invite Tiraspol to participate in talks on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with the EU, ask the EU to extend the preferential trade regime exclusively for Transnistrian companies till the end of 2015, or extend protocol on railway transportation of goods via Transnistria till 2016?

These steps clearly demonstrate that Moldova seeks to extend advantages of European integration and contribute to the economic stability of Transnistria.

As long as businesses are running, few in Transnistria would like to turn the region into a full-time war zone or live in a bombed-out neighborhood. Allegedly, Transnistria selectively leaked information to Ukraine about a planned destabilization in the Odessa oblast.

Thus, the foiling the plot of the “Bessarabian People’s Republic” in May 2015 in Odessa is no surprise. Heavily dependent on exports to the EU and Moldova proper (more than 70 percent) at the time when Russian market is rapidly contracting, Transnistria needs Western trade connections as air to breathe. The dilemma is on which terms to accomplish it.

As EU trade preferences for Transnistria are set to expire in 2015, it is crunch time to join DCFTA provisions and adapt the economy to international standards.

Russia discouraged Transnistria from joining the DCFTA. Consequently, Tiraspol has declined to adhere to the DCFTA and instead opted to speak in the language of ultimatums (e.g., threats to introduce a 100 percent tariff on Moldovan products), hoping to get an extension of free trade with the EU without reforms.

While the EU and Moldova might show flexibility on the issue, softened conditions on DCFTA-related adjustments are likely to be attached to any decision to offer preferential access to the EU market.

If, however, sides fail to hammer out a deal, Transnistria’s economy could collapse in 2016, opening the way for a variety of possible conflicting scenarios in the region. For instance, Russia might decide under pretext of “humanitarian aid” to reinforce its troops in Transnistria (using the airport in Tiraspol). As the most probable way to deliver “aid” is by violating Ukraine’s air space, Transnsitrian issue could easily reignite military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

There has been mounting criticism of Google’s practices from media publishers — most notably the chief executive of the News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch — who argue the company is profiting from online news pages.

In an official blog posted late Tuesday, Josh Cohen, Google’s senior business product manager, said the company had updated its so-called First Click Free program so publishers could limit users to viewing no more than five articles a day without registering or subscribing.

Previously, each click from a Google user was treated as free.

“If you’re a Google user, this means that you may start to see a registration page after you’ve clicked through to more than five articles on the Web site of a publisher using First Click Free in a day ... while allowing publishers to focus on potential subscribers who are accessing a lot of their content on a regular basis,” Mr. Cohen said in the post.

I think the fact is that it's not like it would be a sudden thing, that the people who first found out about it would find out just hours before it hit.

Then a bunch of mumbo jumbo talk about what the government might be able to do if it was discovered that it would be on a collision course with us, if we had the technology and ability to deflect or destroy it.

“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” Revelation 18:4

Pope Francis is intent on bringing Islam into the fold of the Roman Catholic church under the banner of Chrislam, a united Christian-Muslim outreach. He has found a very receptive and willing audience with Muslims wherever he has gone to speak.

ISTANBUL — Pope Francis stood Saturday for two minutes of silent prayer facing east in one of Turkey‘s most important mosques, a powerful vision of Christian-Muslim understanding at a time when neighboring countries are experiencing violent Islamic assault on Christians and religious minorities.

Francis nodded, smiled and looked up in awe as Yaran gave him a tour of the Blue Mosque, famed for its elaborate blue tiles and cascading domes. Presenting the pope with a blue, tulip-designed tile, Yaran said he prayed to God that his visit would “contribute to the world getting along well and living in peace.”

His head bowed, eyes closed and hands clasped in front of him, Francis prayed alongside the Grand Mufti of Istanbul, Rahmi Yaran, in the 17th-century Sultan Ahmet mosque, shifting gears to religious concerns on the second day of his three-day visit to Turkey.

“May God accept it,” Yaran told the pope of their prayer.

The Vatican spokesman, Rev. Federico Lombardi called it a moment of “silent adoration.” Lombardi said Francis told the mufti twice that Christians and Muslims must “adore” God and not just praise and glorify him.

SUBTITLED ROUGH CUT - NO REPORTER NARRATION STORY: Russians laid flowers and tied ribbons outside the Cuban embassy in Moscow on Saturday (November 26) in tribute to Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary leader who built a communist state on the doorstep of the United States. Castro died on Friday (November 25) aged 90, his younger brother and successor Raul Castro announced on state television. For many Russians, Cuba remains a long-term ally which the Soviet Union propped up economically and politically. ""Of course it is a pity. It is a pity that such a person has passed away. We all know of him, what type of leader he was, what an orator, how beautifully he spoke. People in Cuba really loved him, they couldn't live without him. He enchanted them with his speech. Of course it is a pity that he is gone. A world leader is gone. Under America's nose to create Cuba - for America she was a threat,"" said Natalia, a Moscow resident. ""We have known this person since our childhood and we thought really well of him. We thought he was the leader, the successor of Che Guevara, so all that is left to do is to mourn it,"" added her husband, Viktor. But in death just as in life he divided opinion. ""A wonderful beautiful island that was famous all around the world - he destroyed it,"" said Grigory, an engineer in Moscow. ""He created a structure that is not suitable for life. I am on the other side. Of course it is bad that he died, but I think this will be a huge push for Cuba's development."" Mikhail Gorbachev, the final leader of the Soviet Union, said in a statement that Castro left a lasting mark on his country and on world history. In a telegram of condolence to Raul Castro, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the late leader an ""inspiring example for many countries"". ""Fidel Castro was a frank and tried and true friend of Russia,"" the Kremlin quoted the message as saying.

As governments worldwide eye the blockchain technology and ready new cryptocurrency rules, there is no sign bitcoin’s astronomical rise in value, up 81 percent this year, is over.

According to Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the average price of bitcoin hit $$1,839.23 on Thursday after starting the day’s trade session at $$1,732.13. That jump of more than $$100 follows the historical achievement Tuesday of bitcoin breaking $$1,700 for the first time.

What’s driving this mega surge? Recent comments and developments from officials in the US, Japan, and Russia, according to CNBC.

Though the price of the digital currency had already been steadily mounting, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari spoke favorably of the blockchain technology Tuesday before the record price increase of bitcoin.

“I think sentiment has shifted in the markets, in the Fed,” Kashkari told attendees of a technology conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, according to Reuters. “I would say I think conventional wisdom now is that blockchain and the underlying technology is probably more interesting and has more potential than maybe bitcoin does by itself.”

The blockchain is a digital, public ledger on which bitcoin transactions are recorded. Some proponents of the technology say its implications go beyond disrupting government currencies, threatening the status quo in global finance altogether as well as insurance markets and even governments themselves.

Last week, Russia announced that bitcoin would be legal by 2019, Cointelegraph reported. And in March, Japan legalized bitcoin for payments, which led to more purchases of the cryptocurrency with yen.

Back in the US, the infamous Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, are waiting to hear back from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as it reviews its original decision to reject a proposal for an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that facilitates the entry of large institutional investors into the bitcoin market, CNBC reported.

This week isn’t over yet, and already since Monday the market capitalization of bitcoin has surged more than $$3 billion to $$29.53 billion, CNBC reported.

Meanwhile, in the bitcoin community, there is controversy pending over how changes could be made to the blockchain technology, which has been slowing amid a backlog issue. Some people are calling for a “hard fork,” in which two separate bitcoin currencies would operate, though no concrete solution has been proposed yet.

A bloke that everyone just assumed would glide into a professional sporting career, or some other role that demanded respect from nerds, has actually proven that high school social status is so very very irrelevant in the greater scheme of thing.

At 28, the once legendary bully named Michael Harby who had the hottest girlfriend who he used to cheat on, is actually at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to post school performances.

And ironically, he can’t make through to lunch without smoking a huge cone.

Now, between fleeting work throwing shit into a skip bin and hundreds of chances working for his old man – he couldn’t be more of a fuck up. It’s so funny.

In fact the highlight of Michael’s life so far has been briefly thinking he had knocked up a chick from the local leagues club accidentally.

While reminiscing about the good old days, as he often does, in the granny flat underneath his parent’s house – Michael realises he’ll never be as powerful and as important as he was when he was humiliating loser stoners in front of girls at M Block.

“Haha. Fucken nerds” he says

709,2456876.0,sputniknews.com,bias,https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_04_24/212945366/,"Israel joins the chorus accusing Syria of using chemical weapons

On Tuesday, Israel became the third country after Britain and France to claim that Bashar al-Assad's regime had used chemical weapons. While the US is still mulling over its options, unwilling to rush to the conclusion that Syria has crossed the ""red line"", the pressure on Washington to intervene is increasing.

The allegation that Syrian government forces have used chemical weapons against the rebels was made by a top Israeli intelligence officer, Brigadier-General Itai Brun, at a Tel Aviv conference.

""To the best of our understanding, there was use of lethal chemical weapons. Which chemical weapons? Probably sarin"", Brun told Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies. The evidence Israeli intelligence refers to includes photographs allegedly showing victims foaming at the mouth. According to general Brun and his colleague, who only spoke on condition of anonymity, the pictures make them ""nearly 100 percent"" certain that some kind of chemical weapon was used.

Similar statements were recently made by Britain and France. By joining the chorus Israel is obviously trying to emulate Lewis Carroll's Bellman who, in the ""Hunting of the Snark"", said ""What I tell you three times is true.""

The US is apparently expressing skepticism over the assessments; Secretary of State John Kerry said that, in his conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister ""was not in a position to confirm"" the statement made by General Brun.

""I don't know what the facts are,"" Kerry told reporters in Brussels. His words were echoed by Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, who said, ""We are looking for conclusive evidence, if it exists, if there was use of chemical weapons.""

The reluctance of the topmost US officials to jump to an unequivocal conclusion is easily understandable. Last summer, Barack Obama declared that the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad would mean that Syria had crossed the ""red line"" and that would justify direct intervention by the U.S. No, if the administration chooses to believe that the evidence is compelling enough, that would also mean it had to honour its promise.

But lessons from Iraq, which Obama is definitely eager not to repeat, are too fresh in the American public's memory. The administration will therefore linger as long as possible to avoid a decisive commitment.

Still, the pressure is building and for countries like Israel, Britain and France, all of which must surely hope it will be the US who does the dirty work, it is easy to reiterate accusations once in while without really bothering about whether they are true or false.

For Israel the principal concern is that, after the Syrian government collapses, chemical weapons might fall into the hands of jihadi fighters or the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, and this is primarily why Tel Aviv might seek to involve the US in direct action.

It should however also be noted that the chaos in Syria will not simply end if and when the current regime is toppled. That will only lead to the start of a new and totally unpredictable wave of violence which could easily sweep away all of Syria's neighbours, even without the jihadis having access to weapons of mass destruction. Such a wave would not be contained within the Middle East alone and would most definitely spread over a vast area, including those countries that are currently the most vocal proponents of Western military intervention in Syria.

As reported by the BBC on Wednesday, the EU's anti-terror chief, Gilles de Kerchove, has said that there are now Europeans fighting along with rebel forces in Syria against Bashar al-Assad's regime. Their number is estimated at about 500, with the UK and France among the biggest ""contributors"".

""This might lead to a serious threat when they get back,"" said Mr. de Kerchove.

So, maybe instead of concocting a variety of pretexts to incite the US to intervene in Syria's internal affairs, the West should consider over how to eliminate the breeding ground it has created for radicals and terrorists who might later return to menace their biggest ally.",2017-11-13T18:09:27.760857,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Israel joins the chorus accusing Syria of using chemical weapons,Boris Volkhonsky,,"['Israel joins the chorus accusing Syria of using chemical weapons', 'Israel', 'Syria', 'chemical weapons']","On Tuesday, Israel became the third country after Britain and France to claim that Bashar al-Assad's regime had used chemical weapons.

(Before It's News)

As the fall creeps on and winter nears, many people will seek warm refuge in pubs, bars and lounges, or will play bartender in the comfort of their own homes with good company.

Enjoying a few drinks with friends could be a fun way to socialize and wind down from the day. Whether you’re a beer lover, wine aficionado or love a good cocktail, it’s important to remember that alcoholic beverages have calories too (and lots of ‘em!) You can still enjoy your drink of choice, but if you want to live a healthy lifestyle and don’t want to pack on the pounds, remember that portions count! Here’s a few weird but helpful tips to help you enjoy your booze without the bulge.

1038,9320100.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/weekinreview/04overbye.html,"By crashing together subatomic particles — protons — physicists create little fireballs that revisit the conditions of these earlier times and see what might have gone on back then, sort of like the scientists in Jurassic Park reincarnating dinosaurs.

The collider, which is outside Geneva, is 17 miles around. Why is it so big?

Einstein taught us that energy and mass are equivalent. So, the more energy packed into a fireball, the more massive it becomes. The collider has to be big and powerful enough to pack tremendous amounts of energy into a proton.

Moreover, the faster the particles travel, the harder it is to bend their paths in a circle, so that they come back around and bang into each other. The collider is designed so that protons travel down the centers of powerful electromagnets that are the size of redwood trunks, which bend the particles’ paths into circles, creating a collision. Although the electromagnets are among the strongest ever built, they still can’t achieve a turning radius for the protons of less than 2.7 miles.

All in all, the bigger the accelerator, the bigger the crash, and the better chance of seeing what is on nature’s menu.

What are physicists hoping to see?

According to some theories, a whole list of items that haven’t been seen yet — with names like gluinos, photinos, squarks and winos — because we haven’t had enough energy to create a big enough collision.

Any one of these particles, if they exist, could constitute the clouds of dark matter, which, astronomers tell us, produce the gravity that holds galaxies and other cosmic structures together.

Another missing link of physics is a particle known as the Higgs boson, after Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh, which imbues other particles with mass by creating a cosmic molasses that sticks to them and bulks them up as they travel along, not unlike the way an entourage forms around a rock star when they walk into a club.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Have scientists ever seen dark matter?

It’s invisible, but astronomers have deduced from their measurements of galactic motions that the visible elements of the cosmos, like galaxies, are embedded in huge clouds of it.

Will physicists see these gluinos, photinos, squarks and winos?

There is no guarantee that any will be discovered, which is what makes science fun, as well as nerve-racking.

So how much energy do you need to create these fireballs?

At the Large Hadron Collider, that energy is now 3.5 trillion electron volts per proton — about as much energy as a flea requires to do a pushup. That may not sound like much, but for a tiny proton, it is a lot of energy. It is the equivalent of a 200-pound man bulking up by 700,000 pounds.

What’s an electron volt?

An electron volt is the amount of energy an electron would gain passing from the negative to the positive side of a one-volt battery. It is the basic unit of energy and of mass preferred by physicists.

When protons collide, is there a big bang?

There is no sound. It’s not like a bomb exploding.

In previous trials, there was an actual explosion.

All that current is dangerous. During the testing of the collider in September 2008, the electrical connection between a pair of the giant magnets vaporized. There are thousands of such connections in the collider, many of which are now believed to be defective. As a result the collider can only run at half-power for the next two years.

Could the collider make a black hole and destroy the Earth?

The collider is not going to do anything that high-energy cosmic rays have not done repeatedly on Earth and elsewhere in the universe. There is no evidence that such collisions have created black holes or that, if they have, the black holes have caused any damage. According to even the most speculative string theory variations on black holes, the Large Hadron Collider is not strong enough to produce a black hole.

Too bad, because many physicists would dearly like to see one.",2018-02-11 00:44:13.794364,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,A Primer on the Great Proton Smashup,Dennis Overbye,,"['Physics', 'Large Hadron Collider', 'Science and Technology', 'Particle Accelerators']","For those whose physics knowledge was a bit rusty, the news about the Large Hadron Collider might have been puzzling.

5163,5980785.0,www.newsmax.com,,https://www.newsmax.com/Headline/AS-Koreas-Tensions/2017/09/03/id/811404/,"North Korea on Sunday claimed a ""perfect success"" for its most powerful nuclear test so far, a further step in the development of weapons capable of striking anywhere in the United States. President Donald Trump, asked if he would attack the North, said, ""We'll see.""

The latest provocation from the isolated communist country reinforces the danger facing America, Trump had said earlier in a series of tweets, adding that ""talk of appeasement"" is pointless.

""They only understand one thing!"" Trump wrote, without elaboration, as he prepared to meet later with his national security team. It was the first nuclear test since Trump took office in January.

Hours later, after attending church in Washington, the president made his ""We'll see"" comment in response to a question from reporters.

Shortly after, Trump tweeted the U.S. is considering ""stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.""

The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017

The precise strength of the explosion, described by state-controlled media in North Korea as a hydrogen bomb, has yet to be determined. South Korea's weather agency said the artificial earthquake caused by the explosion was five times to six times stronger than tremors generated by the North's previous five such tests. The impact reportedly shook buildings in China and in Russia.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was calling counterparts in Asia, and Trump's treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he was putting together proposed new sanctions for Trump to consider that would seek to cut off trade with North Korea. It's unclear what kind of penalties might make a difference: Lassina Zerbo, head of the U.N. test ban treaty organization, said sanctions already imposed against North Korea aren't working.

Trump warned last month that the U.S. military was ""locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely"" and that the U.S. would unleash ""fire and fury"" on the North if it continued to threaten America. The bellicose words followed threats from North Korea to launch ballistic missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, intending to create ""enveloping fire"" near the military hub that's home to U.S. bombers.

The North's latest test was carried out at 12:29 p.m. local time at the Punggye-ri site where it has conducted past nuclear tests. Officials in Seoul put the magnitude at 5.7; the U.S. Geological Survey said it was a magnitude 6.3. The strongest artificial quake from previous tests was a magnitude 5.3.

""North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States,"" Trump said in the first of a series of tweets.

He branded North Korea ""a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.""

China is by far the North's biggest trading partner, but Trump appeared to be more critical of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has attempted to reach out to the North.

""South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!"" Trump said.

China's official Xinhua News Agency said President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, meeting on the sidelines of a Beijing-led economic summit, agreed ""to adhere to the goal of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, have close communication and coordination and properly respond"" to the test.

North Korea's state-run television broadcast a special bulletin to announce the test and said leader Kim Jong Un attended a meeting of the ruling party's presidium and signed the go-ahead order. Earlier, the party's newspaper ran a front-page story showing photos of Kim examining what it said was a nuclear warhead being fitted onto the nose of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

Sunday's detonation builds on recent North Korean advances that include test launches in July of two ICBMs that are believed to be capable of reaching the mainland U.S. The North says its missile development is part of a defensive effort to build a viable nuclear deterrent that can target U.S. cities.

South Korea held a National Security Council meeting chaired by Moon. Officials in Seoul said Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, spoke with his South Korean counterpart for 20 minutes about an hour after the detonation.

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the test ""absolutely unacceptable.""

Nuclear tests are crucial to perfecting sophisticated technologies and to demonstrating to the world that claims of nuclear prowess are not merely a bluff.

The North claimed the device it tested was a thermonuclear weapon — commonly called a hydrogen bomb. That could be hard to independently confirm. It said the underground test site did not leak radioactive materials, which would make such a determination even harder.

At the same time, the simple power of the blast was convincing. Japan's Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it might have been as powerful as 70 kilotons. North Korea's previous largest was thought to be anywhere from 10 to 30 kilotons.

""We cannot deny it was an H-bomb test,"" Onodera said.

North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year and has been launching missiles at a record pace this year. It fired a potentially nuclear-capable midrange missile over northern Japan last week in response to ongoing U.S.-South Korea military exercises.

It said that launch was the ""curtain raiser"" for more activity to come.

Just before Sunday's test, according to state media, Kim and the other senior leaders at the party presidium meeting discussed ""detailed ways and measures for containing the U.S. and other hostile forces' vicious moves for sanctions.""

The photos released earlier showed Kim talking with his lieutenants as he observed a silver, peanut-shaped device that the state-run media said was designed to be mounted on the North's ""Hwasong-14"" ICBM.

The North claims the device was made domestically and has explosive power that can range from tens to hundreds of kilotons. For context, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima by the U.S. had a 15-kiloton yield.

North Korea's recent activity has been especially bold.

The North followed its two ICBM tests by announcing a plan to fire intermediate range missiles toward Guam. Kim signed off on the plan, but is watching the moves by the U.S. before deciding when or whether to carry it out.

Guam is a sore point for the North because it is home to a squadron of B-1B bombers that the North fears could be used to attack their country. The U.S. on Thursday had sent the bombers and F-35 stealth fighters to the sky over South Korea in a show of force — and North Korea strongly protested.

Options to pressure Pyongyang would appear to be limited. Further economic and trade sanctions, increased diplomatic pressure and boosting military maneuvers or shows of force would likely all be on the table.

The two Koreas have shared the world's most heavily fortified border since their war in the early 1950s ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea as deterrence against North Korea.",2017-11-27T01:15:02.476695,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,Trump on Attacking NKorea: 'We'll See',,,"['AS', 'Koreas', 'Tensions']",Trump on Attacking NKorea: 'We'll See',"Russia, Gun Rights, ISIS/Islamic State, Trump Administration, Donald Trump",,
136,160.0,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/finding-wonder-foreboding-pathway-total-eclipse/,"It is rather hard to write with eclipse glasses on this morning, but “I want to be ready,” as the old spiritual intones. Not ever known for culinary process, I even tried to turn Oreos into eclipse cookies. Massive fail!

Like many others, I have anticipated this day with a sense of foreboding and wonder. The foreboding is a lot less than the wonder, to be sure. The foreboding in my case has to do with religious quacks that claim a natural scientific event is an act of God’s judgment or an apocalyptic event signaling the end of time. That this portent, which happens quite regularly, by the way, has to haul this fake theological freight creates a stumbling block to coherent belief. It is a responsible perspective to hold a worldview that attends to the wisdom of both theology and science.

Another of these celestial alignments will happen in 2024, and I suspect many of the same arguments will be in vogue. It will be an election year, so beware! Some will proclaim that God is judging a “godless nation” by blotting out the sun, and who knows but this might be the very last chance we have to repent. Please understand, I am all for repentance — deep, daily and determined. God’s call always beckons us to turn around to traverse a more life-giving pathway, but I demur at the heated rhetoric of an interventionist theology that only sees God active in the cataclysmic.

God is at work in the regularity of seasons, circadian rhythms and evolutionary trajectories. The old language of calling a brutal storm or other inexplicable event an “act of God” is receding, thankfully.

I do recall when Yorkminster Cathedral was hit by lightning in 1980 and insurance adjustors and religious figures debated whether to call it a divine action. Some concluded that it was because of a liberal bishop; others were less convinced. It is hard to believe that this language persists.

Better to see the whole of creation within providential care, even if it is not a tightly controlled oversight. Terrible and beautiful things occur, often all mixed up together. God is not absent from any of them, and the presence of suffering provokes interrogation of a benevolent deity. Human participation in the unfinished, groaning creation sometimes wreaks more havoc; it is hard to calculate the extent of our influence for good or evil.

Wonder far outstrips foreboding, however. I am thrilled by the fervor with which people have planned ahead to secure the best viewing spots. I delight in the ways this astronomical occasion provides teachers with an expansive scientific lesson. I relish the new learning about animal and crop behavior during a solar eclipse, especially as this is a key concern for those of us who live in the plains. I chortle at the kids who tried out their glasses days in advance, just in case. I revel, also, in the capacity of humans to experience wonder. We were made for this, you know.

It was Rudolf Otto, a scholar of religion in the early 20th century, who wrote about the “idea of the holy,” contending that each one of us has an inherent response to the numinous realities of life. By numinous he meant a divine power at work that invites us to a sense of mystery, fear and, perhaps, worship. At the heart of the religious impulse is the sense of grandeur of God’s creation, the idea that something lies behind the phenomena of earthly processes. A pious Christian, Otto sought to defend belief from naturalistic tendencies, the argument that the whole of this world can be explained without a theistic hypothesis.

It is very instructive for human beings to experience themselves as both infinitesimal and significant, with an appropriate understanding of their place in the scale of our universe. This means we understand that we are latecomers, beneficiaries of a long history that preceded us. We are dependent on all the life forms that have gone before, as well as those that continue to companion humanity today. It also means that the glorious beauty that surrounds us points to a vast intelligence beyond our comprehension. Our recognition of both our frailty and magnificent vocation as God’s image bearers kindles wonder that God is mindful of us, as Psalm 8 states.

I hope our experience of this event illumines a spirit of contemplation as we marvel at God’s handiwork and the perdurance of an expanding universe. I also hope that we find ever more constructive ways to hold both science and faith in our heart. We must read both books — of Scripture and of nature. Holding them together makes for an informed sense of wonder.

During an interview with IRNA published on Saturday, Ryabkov stressed that Iran has honored all its commitments to the landmark deal.

“The JCPOA has so far had positive outcomes and Iran responsibly carries out all its commitments. Russia also abides to the responsibilities it accepted,” he said.

While still campaigning, US President Donald Trump threatened to annul the deal, which he has lambasted as “the worst accord ever negotiated” and “one of the dumbest” ones he has come across.

While noting that there was no point in threatening Iran as history has proven that such actions are useless, Ryabkov stated that Russia does not agree with Trump’s stance on the deal.

“We do not share the US’s stance and believe that the JCPOA was drawn up with very precise devices and balanced mechanisms. Taking these conditions into account, there is no room for worries over the JCPOA or its implementation,” he added.

He noted that the new US administration will reach the same conclusion after scrutinizing the accord.

Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China -- plus Germany started implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on January 16, 2016.

Under the agreement, Iran accepted to put limitations on its program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions imposed against Tehran.

Trump’s stance against the JCPOA comes while Washington’s partners in the P5+1 have thrown their weight behind the Iran deal. The EU has already said that it is in complete agreement with China and Russia over the necessity to keep the JCPOA alive.

Re “Miep Gies, 100, the Last of Those Who Hid Anne Frank and Her Family” (obituary, Jan. 12):

Today, as too many Americans disdain the notion of any personal responsibility to fellow citizens in need, we might reflect on the legacy of Miep Gies.

The empathy, courage and selflessness of Mrs. Gies, and the ever-enduring grace of Anne Frank, were once the kinds of behaviors we valued most in human beings. In our current state of narcissism, we would do well to revisit them.

Originally, the Supreme Court had allowed the Trump administration to reinstate part of the travel ban at the end of 2017; however, the federal appeals court in San Francisco found that Trump had overstepped his authority. According to Reuters:

‘The appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump had exceeded the authority Congress had given him over immigration and had violated a part of the immigration laws barring discrimination in the issuance of visas.’

In their appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco remarked:

‘The courts below have overridden the president’s judgments on sensitive matters of national security and foreign relations, and severely restricted the ability of this and future presidents to protect the nation.’

Those against the travel ban have continually argued that Trump’s ban is unconstitutional as it is directed unfairly toward countries that have a majority of Muslim citizens. They point to Trump’s own comments during his presidential campaign regarding Muslims.

‘The president has repeatedly explained that the two orders pursue the same aim.’

However, the Trump team have denied the allegations of discrimination.

‘The proclamation’s process and substance confirm that its purpose was to achieve national security and foreign-policy goals, not to impose anti-Muslim bias.’

Arguments are planned for April, and the court estimates a ruling will come by June. Additionally, the Supreme Court has a docket loaded with major issues including “voting rights, union power, digital privacy and a clash between claims of religious freedom and gay rights.”

665,9409756.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/arts/design/proposed-smithsonian-latino-museum-faces-hurdles.html,"The idea for a Smithsonian Latino museum was born in the mid-1990s when a task force said the Smithsonian had largely ignored Latinos in its exhibitions and should create at least one museum to correct that imbalance.

Photo

The panel’s report, entitled “Willful Neglect,” found, for example, that only 2 of the 470 people featured in the “notable Americans” section of the National Portrait Gallery were Latino.

Since then the Smithsonian has set aside money for Latino exhibitions and created an internal office to promote them. It agreed that a Latino heritage museum in San Antonio, which opened in 2007, be designated as an affiliate. Called the Museo Alameda, the institution is allowed to borrow materials from the Smithsonian, but is not financed by it.

There are dozens of other museums across the country that focus on the heritage or culture of Latinos, whose population in the United States grew by 43 percent over the last decade, according to 2010 Census figures. But supporters of the national museum say it is imperative that there be a similar presence in the nation’s capital.

While the commission is not expected to make specific proposals about content, the museum would probably try to cover a wide swath of history, from the role of the Spanish conquistadors to the work of Latinos in the labor and civil-rights movements. It would include culture, from popular music to visual arts, and would try to feature people and traditions from all Hispanic countries.

Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy organization, said it was unfortunate that Latino children who now travel to the Mall cannot see “their community and history and legacy reflected.”

She said that a museum that accomplishes that is particularly crucial now because discussions of immigration issues have created a “toxic” environment for Latinos. “It’s even more important to show other Americans that our roots go back centuries on this continent,” she said.

Though legislation to authorize a Latino museum commission, known formally as the National Museum of the American Latino Commission, was first introduced in 2003 by Representative Xavier Becerra, a Democrat of California, it did not pass until 2008, as part of an omnibus budget bill.

The economy and the balance of power in Congress have changed much since that vote, with Republicans now holding a 49-vote majority in the House of Representatives.

Federal money for the museum would not appear to be an option, members of Congress say, as it was for the African-American and Indian museums. The National Museum of African American History and Culture has a $500 million price tag, half of which is being paid by the federal government. The government paid for two-thirds of the Indian museum.

Commission leaders chose in recent days not to speak about their report before they brief Congress, in the first week of May. But it is anticipated that the panel will suggest that should a museum be authorized by the government, most of the financing could be raised privately.

Smithsonian officials have said they are open to the idea of including a Latino museum in their network, though some concede that it would be difficult to raise money for such an institution from the private sector while they are still committed to raising $250 million to finish the African-American museum.

Supporters of a national women’s history museum are also currently seeking Congressional approval to locate a new institution on federal land across the street from the Mall.

Opposition to the Latino museum at this point is muted, and with the commission not yet having presented its report, few in Congress beyond the group of ardent supporters have focused on the issue.

Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican of Georgia, said in an interview that he supported a Latino museum as long as it was not financed with federal money, and as long as he was assured that the museum would not become “an interest group’s platform to advance political agendas.”

Photo

Representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican who is a member of the Republican-controlled Congressional Hispanic Conference, has in the past expressed ambivalence about the idea of a separate Latino museum, saying that he preferred the idea of a museum dedicated to all immigrants.

A spokesman for Mr. Nunes, Andrew House, said in an e-mail that Mr. Nunes still supported the idea of a museum of American immigrants, provided it is privately financed.

The Latino museum commission envisions a 310,000-square-foot building, roughly the same size as the African-American museum. As of last summer it had narrowed its list of desired sites to four, all of them on the National Mall.

Three of the options would entail additions to existing buildings — including, in one case, the vacant Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building.

But any construction on the Mall can be controversial. Judy Scott Feldman, the president of the National Coalition to Save Our Mall, said her group opposes any construction on the mall until a new master plan is created to guide development.

“What’s happening is we just keep jamming things into the limited space,” she said.

When the Latino commission started its work in 2009, supporters predicted the museum might be up and running in a decade. Today Mr. Rodriguez, the lobbyist, said, the path looks longer. He said he hoped to persuade politicians with large Latino constituencies of the merits of the proposal and build from that.

“I was in a conversation with a colleague of mine the other day,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “I said, ‘You know, the African-American museum was in process for some 25 years,’ and they said, ‘No, actually, 75 years.’ ”

Mr. Rodriguez paused in his recollection, and added, “We don’t want to get to that position.”",2018-02-11 00:45:10.168992,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,National Latino Museum Plan Faces Fight,Kate Taylor,,"['Museums', 'Smithsonian Institution', 'Becerra  Xavier', 'National Mall (Washington  DC)', 'Hispanic-Americans']",A move to create a new Smithsonian museum is running into a crowded National Mall and lack of will to pay for it.,,,nytimes

In the secretary’s new book, Worthy Fights, he outlines his criticism of President Obama and the administration for its inaction, especially in regard to pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq and other foreign policy issues.

7378,4816726.0,thetruthaboutcancer.com,junksci,https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/what-causes-cancer/,"Through the ages, many have attempted to explain both what cancer is and what causes cancer.

Explanations that are frequently given for what cancer is or is caused by include:

a fungus, a bacterial infection, a virus or viruses, parasites

low oxygen

acidic pH and emotional stress, and/or unresolved emotional issues

While virtually all of those things may indeed contribute to cancer, none of them accurately describe what cancer actually is or what the primary cause of cancer is.

The True Primary Cause of Cancer

In order to understand what cancer is and what causes cancer, you must first recognize that cancer is largely a disease created by man. With the possible exception of stress and unresolved emotional conflicts, virtually every proposed cause of cancer has been around for thousands of years.

Viruses, funguses, bacteria, parasites… you name it and they have always been present. In many instances they were more prevalent in times past when there was a much lower incidence of cancer. I will grant you that life is more hectic in today’s developed world than it was in simpler times. However, I think that there was nevertheless considerable stress and emotional burdens during the past too.

So what is it that has changed from the time when the rate of cancer was almost non-existent to where it has grown at a steep and largely steady rate? And notably to the point that today one in every two men and one in every three women are expected to encounter cancer in their lifetime?

Some might point to the fact that our lifespans have gotten ever longer (at least until very recently), and certainly cancer strikes at increasing rates as we age. However, that doesn’t explain why cancer has increased across all age groups.

The ONLY answer that can explain the rise of cancer which correlates precisely with the increased incidence of cancer is toxins. This is especially so if you consider the various forms of radiation to be toxins.

Granted that correlation does not always equal causation, but it does more often than not, and in the instance of cancer it is simply the only thing that makes sense.

Certainly there are other contributing factors such as cancer-causing foods in our standard Western diet, but there is simply no other sensible explanation. And frankly I have a very difficult time seeing how anybody who looks objectively at the facts could think differently. I can only suppose that they have not taken the time to take a thorough objective look. Or maybe they have wedded themselves to an idea, possibly for their own profit, to the point that they refuse to consider more logical alternatives.

Otto Warburg won a Nobel Prize for discovering that cancer cells typically had low levels of oxygen. His discovery has been misreported far and wide as being a discovery that low oxygen causes cancer. Sometimes it is reported that he found that acidic pH also caused cancer, an idea which also has plenty of proponents. Neither one is true, though the misrepresentation has helped sell no end of books, products, and services. All of this based in large part on the idea that you can beat cancer with oxygen or beat cancer by raising pH levels.

Cancer cells have low oxygen and people with cancer have acidic pH levels because of the cancer process itself. Cancer cells stop taking in oxygen for respiration and revert to a more primitive form of respiration which utilizes glucose. A by-product of glucose respiration is lactic acid. Thus cancer cells have low oxygen levels and as the cancer progresses the blood pH becomes increasingly acidic from increased acid production.

(For more information about what Otto Warburg actually discovered and the roles of oxygen and pH in cancer, see my TTAC article: What Otto Warburg Actually Discovered About Cancer.)

In less developed countries such as many of those in Africa, proposed cancer causes such as funguses, viruses, bacteria, and parasites are much more abundant than in the Western world. If any of those items were primary causes of cancer (as opposed to contributing causes), then the incidence of cancer should be greater. But it isn’t.

In fact, just the opposite is true and their cancer rates are much lower than ours. It is only when the “developed world’s” industry and diet are introduced that cancer rates begin to climb steeply − and the climb continues as more and more Western industry and Western diets are introduced. Once again, the only thing which explains that is toxins.

As the late, great French scientist Antoine Bechamp told us almost 150 years ago… cancer and most other illness is caused by a combination of toxins and poor cellular terrain. Poor cellular terrain can be described as cells which have not been properly nourished, hydrated, cleansed, and oxygenated.

What Cancer Actually Is

That brings us to what cancer really is. Cancer is a survival mechanism, as Andreas Moritz pointed out in his book Cancer is Not a Disease – It is a Survival Mechanism. Cells that are put under stress by exposure to toxins, inflammation, and cellular stress can cause changes in the cellular mitochondria. In this process RNA instructions change so that the cells under stress revert to a primitive form of ATP energy production (respiration) whereby the cells stop taking in oxygen and begin using glucose to produce energy.

The cells also refuse to die. They multiply, and create a protective layer which makes them harder to kill. Normally, when cells are taking in oxygen for respiration, oxidation from Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) helps the cells undergo programmed cellular death via apoptosis or autophagy. When oxygen is no longer being taken in, such death does not occur.

Author’s Note: I have spent literally thousands of hours researching cancer, including mentoring by people I consider giants in the field. I certainly don’t know it all – far from it, and I am learning more every day. However, I do know enough to know that, though many things can contribute to cancer, toxins are indeed the primary cause. I am also pretty confident that I have a good idea about what cancer really is. As an example of not knowing it all and learning more every day, I still shake my head wryly when I think about how I pooh-poohed Andreas Moritz proposing that cancer was a defense mechanism when I first heard about it. But he was absolutely spot on. Ah, you live and you learn…or try to.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

(Before It's News)

Though Yevgeny Zamyatin’s “We” and Aldous Huxley’s ”Brave New World” seem more accurate, George Orwell was on to something when he described the three continuously warring regions of Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia in “1984.” We stand at the precipice of this prophecy.

As American status now steadily declines, often mentioned as necessary in the writings of the Council on Foreign Relations going back even to its 1920’s beginnings, a new order certainly is coming into being.

Its model is Europe, the key weapon in its arsenal is terrorism and anyone standing in its way is literally crushed.

Council prophet P.E. Corbett wrote back in the 1940’s how “the vast majority of people in Great Britain believe that the establishment of a new world order must begin with the federation of Europe.”[1]

Another later priest, Geoff Mulgan, declared that “much of the power associated with global government was taken first, and then legitimized afterwards. This is certainly the story of the United Nations in 1945, the creation of a small bold group who seized a historical moment. The growth of the European Union shows the same characteristics.”[2]

Sharing the Burden of Global Government

The Trilateral Commission founder’s vision is now coming into being. As the U.S. declines in power, Europe continues to keep its head above water and China rises to a level playing field. This is where the elite power struggle ensues as pampered old men play musical chairs and decide who will bear the ring of power.

In a recent New York Times column by Council propagandists, this much was said, albeit in internationalist lingo (globalspeak). “The driving force behind these global policy innovations has been neither America nor China, but a third power which is increasingly overlooked: Europe. “

They have spent fifty years in their Bilderberg laboratory, experimenting with the economic formulas, ratios and governance systems. The rest of the world surely shall not have to wait this long to be blessed with regional integration, the model is ready for export and long has its process of application begun in the Americas, Asia and elsewhere.

“We live in a ‘G-3’ world” the author declares, based on US-NATO military might, Chinese slave labor and European City of London finance. These are the “producers of global governance, while most other states are receivers.”

International Terrorism as a Weapon

The Council recently proclaimed 9/11 a success in bringing the world together. It serves as a pretext for:

World militarization by the U.S. (NATO) and the internationalization of intelligence (think global CIA!).

It further desires indefinable “terrorism” to be defined as a human rights violation “given the threat it poses to freedom from fear.” Freedom from fear! (The author will now partake in his two minutes of hate; the reader is left to analyze this absurd statement).

The cherry on top is the establishment of an enforcement body to make sure all countries “comply” in their fight on “terrorism” or “violation of human rights”; this will basically be defined as anyone who criticizes the state apparatus, as envisioned in the prophecies of Zamyatin, Huxley and Orwell, which brings us to the next point.

One need only heed the warning of Russian General Leonid Ivashov. He defines “terrorism” as an “instrument of world politics” contributing to a “world dominance and the submissiveness of states to a global oligarchy,” the installation of a unipolar world with a “sole world headquarters” and the erasure of national borders.

Goals include:

Depriving the populace of a means to fight back.

The consolidation of international law.

The consolidation of world power into a few regions instead of a few hundred states.

To have the UN scientific elites pose as philosopher kings.

Contrive a world religion.

Depriving People of the Legitimate Right to Fight Back Against Aggression

Finally, in their globalspeak (internationalist lingo), they label Gaddafi’s regime as an impediment to Libyan regional integration and “good news for Maghreb unity.” Gaddafi “stood in the way of the development of oil-rich Libya.” Again, this is globalspeak for “he stood in the way of ‘our’ oil.”

The General details how “S. Hussein who banned dollar circulation in all spheres of Iraq’s economy including oil trade was displaced and executed and his country was left in ruins. M. Gadhafi started switching Libya’s oil and gas business to gold-backed Arab currencies and air raids against the country followed almost immediately… Tehran had to put its plan to stay dollar-free on hold to avoid falling victim to aggression.”

Gaddafi’s Libya was higher on the human development index than the regional average and that of the world. The undernourished population percentage was less than that of developed countries!

However, we can have none of that. Remember, the global oligarchy of philosopher kings are a psychopathic bunch (of old geezers). Thus Mr. Gaddafi had to go.

(A more realistic portrait of Gaddafi)

So too, they say, must we go. Though, go we will not without a fight. One thing the internationalists forget is that they too must go one day, and when they play away from their home field, they will have another thing coming.

Even after a meeting between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Donald Trump at the White House, they were unable to come to any promising ground.

And now, the finger-pointing has begun, and Trump is pointing a big, sausagy orange stub at Democrats. Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to lay all the blame on congressional Democrats.

He tweeted:

‘Democrats are holding our Military over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!’

Hold up a minute. During the momentous roundtable that was caught on camera, Trump displayed a shocking moment where many thought he’d actually work with Democrats to reach a deal. Granted, Republicans almost had a conniption fit when Trump said he’d sign anything put in front of him.

After saying that, he was presented with a bipartisan deal, and he refused to sign it.

Additionally, Trump can point that little orange nub at Democrats all he wants, but at one point he did say he thought a government shutdown would be good for the country.

Back in 2013, he tweeted:

‘[email protected] leadership should not be afraid of a government shutdown. They should be afraid of not defunding ObamaCare.’

He also tweeted:

‘83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed. Room for cuts.’

Then there was this tweet:

‘Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown. Markets like being left alone for a day.’

Then in 2017 as the president of the United States he tweeted:

‘either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good “shutdown” in September to fix mess!’

Here’s the real kicker, though. Schumer offered Trump his precious wall. He offered to put the border wall “on the table,” and Trump still said no.

Also, it should be noted four Senate Republicans voted no on the measure Friday night.

Twitter users went nuts over Trump’s most recent tweet. You can check out their responses below.

How Jack Molinas Almost Destroyed

the Game of Basketball.

By Charley Rosen.

428 pp. New York:

Seven Stories Press. $27.95.

JACK MOLINAS was probably the greatest fixer of basketball games in history, the Mephistopheles of college sports. Between 1957 and 1961, he had no fewer than 27 collegiate programs in the bag, including St. John's and the University of Alabama, and managed to rig the outcomes of at least 43 games, leading to the arrests of 37 players and the shaming of several others. The most notable casualty was Connie Hawkins, an inner-city Wunderkind who should have been the Julius Erving of his day but instead was sent home from the University of Iowa and spent his prime years banned from the National Basketball Association. Molinas is long forgotten now, but during this time he was a one-man career-wrecking machine who brought into question basketball's status as a legitimate sport.

Molinas, who had had a Jewish middle-class upbringing in the Bronx, was a sort of double prodigy in his own right. He took up both gambling and basketball in 1944, when he was 12 years old, and by the time he was starring for Stuyvesant High School and then Columbia University, he was working with a mob-backed bookmaker -- betting against his own team, at times throwing games outright, at other times playing hard enough to win but intentionally bungling shots and dropping passes in order to stay under the point spread. ''To Molinas, playing in a rigged ball game was more exhilarating than playing it straight,'' Charley Rosen writes in ''The Wizard of Odds.'' ''Was it time to kick a pass out of bounds, or get called for a three-second violation? Or should he go on a scoring binge to make his own statistics respectable? . . . Molinas loved the idea of playing so many secret games at the same time.'' Standing 6-foot-6, with a superb one-handed push shot from the perimeter (the jumper hadn't yet come into its own) and a hook shot that made him deadly near the basket, Molinas was, briefly, one of the premier high-scoring forwards in the fledgling N.B.A., before he was suspended for gambling during his first and only season with the Fort Wayne Pistons.

Having corrupted himself so successfully as a youth, Molinas traveled from campus to campus corrupting others with prostitutes and cash. At the time, there wasn't much honest money to be made from basketball; Molinas himself was offered only $10,000 for his year in professional basketball. Yet the students he recruited could make $1,000 for a single night's work. Molinas would in turn sell the fixed game to a bookmaker for a price of, say, $10,000, and then bet another several thousand of his own on the game. At his height, he and his partners were clearing $50,000 a week.

It could get complicated. In the afternoon leading up to a game between Alabama and Tulane in 1959, Molinas was on the phone constantly with bookies and gangsters in different cities, and with Alabama's star player, Lenny Kaplan, feeding them various betting and game-fixing instructions and then managing the shifting point spread right up until game time with such precision that he could make money on seemingly contradictory wagers.

Molinas was ''born bent,'' in the words of Neil Isaacs, a sportswriter who wrote a novel about him. He was a compulsive gambler and a compulsive scam artist. He once fixed a boxing match by having a fighter drugged. He tried to fix races by using a remote electric buzzer that would give horses a motivational jolt in the rear end. He even had his own version of time travel: through a Con Edison connection, he was able to reduce the electricity feeding back-room betting parlors; this was barely detectable, but it was enough to put the clocks a minute behind by post time, enabling Molinas to bet on horse races that had just finished. Even while he was in prison, he got involved in a scheme that used a signature machine to forge checks.",2018-02-11 00:36:35.413311,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Double Dribbling,Eric Konigsberg,,"['ROSEN  CHARLEY', 'MOLINAS  JACK', 'REVIEWS', 'BOOKS AND LITERATURE', 'WIZARD OF ODDS  THE (BOOK)']",Eric Konigsberg reviews book The Wizard of Odds: How Jack Molinas Almost Destroyed the Game of Basketball by Charley Rosen (M),,,nytimes

A pair of smashed automobile windshields by Kelley Walker lie next to it.

On the south wall a pointillist painting by Wayne Gonzales projects the hazy, photographic image of flag-draped coffins in a cargo plane. Three dead sentinels stand nearby: cartoonish legs with only a naked spinal column from the waist up by Jason Fox; a drooping head on a pike lovingly carved from red-and-green striated marble by Barry X Ball; and ''Ghost,'' a blocky specter made mostly of white plastic foam by Huma Bhabha.

Videos by Joan Wallace show a white frosted cake exploding in slow motion, revealing bloody red insides. A star within concentric rings drawn in graphite on a black panel by Gardar Eide Einarsson adds to the funereal mood. A small photograph of a ruined sphinx's rear paw by Trisha Donnelly called ''The Hand That Holds the Desert Down'' might be a metaphor for human hubris. And a text piece by Louise Lawler that reads, ''Once there was a little boy and everything turned out alright. The end,'' though created in 1993, seems here an allusion to our recently departed president.

Doreen Trowsdale, 77, died of a pulmonary embolism caused by DVT just days after being sent home from York Hospital's A&E department with medicine for a urinary tract infection. The pensioner's daughter Fiona Nixon has now received an £8,000 payout after hospital bosses admitted Mrs Trowsdale's death would not have happened had her condition been correctly diagnosed.

Heartbroken Mrs Nixon, 43, said: ""We all thought my mum had a lot of life left in her.

""Her last days were filled with fear and when she passed the last thing she said to us was 'make sure they don't get away with this'.""

But after returning to her nearby home in Driffield, East Yorkshire, the mother-of-two was tended by paramedics complaining of swelling, tenderness and warm skin in her left leg - the primary symptoms of DVT.

Mrs Nixon said the stress of her mother's death had taken its toll on the whole family with her brother Andrew, 50, forced to take early retirement from the fire service. She added: ""Seeing someone you love go so suddenly and in such a terrible way is horrendous. It is the last thing you want for one of your parents.

163,191.0,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/what-is-sown-in-the-heart/,"A trip to the cardiologist is rarely routine. Usually a precipitating episode or a prior procedure prompts the appointment, and we are eager to receive a reassuring assessment. We know that the condition of the heart determines our health, and we listen with rapt attention to learn how we are really doing.

This past winter while teaching at Conception Abbey, I had a viral infection that mimicked some sort of heart trouble. Being taken to the infirmary in a male monastery was exciting for all concerned — monks and patient alike. I got to see parts of the monastery that are off-limits for women, so I dutifully closed my eyes (well, most of the time). Thankfully, all checked out well after a trip to a regional hospital and a follow-up with my cardiologist. Truly, I gained a new appreciation for my heart.

The Bible speaks of the heart frequently, making it the most common anthropological term in the Scripture. It is the vital center of a person, and it supplies the nourishment that is life-giving. In our time, we think the brain to be the center of human activity, directing the rhythms of an individual’s body; from the ancients’ viewpoint, the heart was the central organ that moved the rest of the body.

Scripture also speaks of the heart as the source of emotional, intellectual and moral activities. Thus, it plays a significant role in spiritual health, as the heart gathers up one’s whole being. It is the locus of faith; it orients a person’s life, and we should be wary of giving our heart to other than God. As Martin Luther said, belief is “that upon which we lean our heart.”

The Gospel reading for this coming Sunday includes the parable of the sower. Jesus speaks of varied responses to the word of the coming reign of God, and he warns how hard it is to be faithful to it, for “the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing” (Matthew 13:22). The word intends to rehabilitate the human heart, which can be “hardened,” “wicked,” “godless,” in biblical parlance.

When one broadcasts seed rather than carefully spaced planting, seeds can end up in varied contexts. Good soil can encourage growth, but rocky soil or a thorny patch or a trodden path make it very hard for the seed to bear plentiful yields. Varied elements conspire to keep the seed (the word) from accomplishing its true intent, to renew the heart by grace.

Responding to the word of God is not an easy thing, for it puts us at odds with the dominant culture of our world, which is all about acquisition, comfort and personal security. Jesus warns that the claim of this word is difficult: “When anyone hears the word of the basileia (the reign of God) and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart …” (v. 19).

Consumerist Christianity has performed a convenient work-around so as to ease the burden of Jesus’ claim. We have relegated his warning to the status of “interim ethics.” Jesus could only expect his followers to be radical in their fidelity because the world would soon end; he would return and rescue them from the challenge of living in a world of competing claims. He surely could not have meant for people to live in the economics of grace long term.

Wallace Hartsfield II suggests to his preaching students at our seminary that one who proclaims must find the original claim of the text on the hearer, the claim for the hearer today and the claim upon the preacher. This parable would make more sense in an agricultural setting; however, its pungent insights remain and call hearers of the word to examine their response and think about what issues forth from the heart, as well its chief longing.

I recently had the opportunity to write a blurb for an important book authored by Elizabeth Hinson-Hasty. In her forthcoming text, The Problem of Wealth, she challenges assumptions about why people are in poverty and calls for a new vision of community requiring economic justice. By delineating the problem when theology and economics are not integrally related, she is echoing the teaching of the parable. Wealth is the problem, she contends, for it tramples compassion for the economic other. Once again, it is a matter of the heart.

When the word of God takes lodging in our hearts, we are beckoned toward generative living, little satisfied with only the world’s goods. Where the heart is located and what fruit it bears makes all the difference for the treasure that is God’s emerging reign.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,What is sown in the heart – Baptist News Global,Molly T.

To the right is the Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrat members of Congress joined with conservative evangelicals, including National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference President the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, to promote legislation to replace the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.

At a press conference held Thursday afternoon that featured Democrat and evangelical leaders, as well as several Dreamers, or young people affected by the rescinding of DACA, former House Speaker Pelosi stated there was ""nothing partisan, nothing political"" about the effort to replace DACA.

""We know we have to address some issues that relate to border security and we hope that we can do that in very short order,"" said Pelosi, adding that ""we take hope in the commitment of President Donald Trump"" to sign any legislation brought to his desk.

""We are proud to be with our Dreamers, who make America more American, with the hope, the determination, the optimism, the insistence on making the future better for the next generation. Those are American traits.""

In his remarks, Rodriguez, who gave a prayer at Trump's inauguration, explained that President Trump cares about the well-being of the children of illegal immigrants and wants to sign legislation securing their legal status.

""The president wants to make this happen. He wants to make this happen. He's a grandfather and a father. He has expressed that to me personally in the White House: 'I don't want to harm these kids. I want to make this happen,'"" said Rodriguez.

Rodriguez also spoke about the ""clarion call"" for border security coming from both the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress.

""The wall is a physical object created by man. 800,000 human beings created in the Image of God by God,"" noted Rodriguez.

""So if we have to build a wall in order to secure and save 800,000 lives, let's make that happen as expeditiously as possible ... let's build a wall, simultaneously saving 800,000 kids.""

Also in attendance for the press conference were Bishop Harry Jackson, senior pastor of Hope Christian Church, and Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Last September, the Trump administration announced that they were rescinding the Obama-era DACA program, which temporarily protected immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children.

In a statement read to the press, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being ""rescinded"" as it was viewed as an unlawful unilateral action on the part of the previous administration.

""This policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after Congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens,"" stated Sessions.

""In other words, the executive branch, through DACA, deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.""

The full rescinding of DACA was given a six-month delay so that Congress could pass legislation on behalf of those, commonly called Dreamers, threatened with deportation once the program was gone.

Earlier this month, federal judge William Alsup of San Francisco issued a temporary block to the administration's ending of DACA, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security's ""decision to rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise.""

""As a result, DACA recipients who failed to renew their status by last year's deadline will have a chance to submit renewal applications. The decision does not, however, allow new applications to be submitted,"" reported the Hill.

Johnnie Moore, a religious freedom advocate and evangelical leader with strong ties to the Trump administration, helped to organize the press conference.

In a statement posted to Twitter, Moore explained that ""nearly every Republican, as well as @POTUS himself, believe this is the just thing to do.""

""It is the job of Congress to make laws & not according to their opinions but the opinions of their constituents. Our system demands compromise. We encourage & pray for a #DACADeal,"" added Moore.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi Joins Trump-Supporting Evangelicals to Advance DACA Legislation,,,[''],"Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrat members of Congress joined with conservative evangelicals, including National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference President the Rev.

Meeting the Elites

There are several individuals holding leadership positions with Goldman Sachs who represent what we refer to as the global ruling class ” or global plutocracy ” by virtue of their multiple positions on numerous boards and advisory groups, think tanks, educational institutions, and other important institutions of influence, giving them unparalleled access to policy-makers around the world.

Its not surprising that with individuals like Stephen Friedman, Peter Sutherland and John C. Whitehead holding leadership positions with Goldman Sachs, the bank has established a highly influential network of affiliations with some of the worlds major institutions and policy-makers. The vampire squid has indeed spread its tentacles far beyond mere financial influence; through its affiliations with global plutocrats who serve on its boards, Goldman is a cosmopolitical conglomerate with ever-expansive power.

Even mother nature cant seem to take on Goldman Sachs. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York City in November of 2012, power was knocked out for more than 1 million New Yorkers. But the banks 200 West Street headquarters were shining bright, lights glowing and music playing. With heaps and sandbags surrounding the building and generators running, Goldman sent off a lone, ominous blue glow into the stormy night: a symbol to all that even in the worst of circumstances, amid a sea of human suffering, Goldman Sachs remains ever present, lights on doing business and making money.

1888,6112032.0,dailywire.com,bias,http://www.dailywire.com/news/4036/trumps-campaign-manager-thinks-violence-shouldnt-hank-berrien,"Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, apparently has one set of rules for himself and one for everyone else when it comes to using violence or cheating to get his own way.

Speaking recently of people who had allegedly been roughed up at Trump rallies, Lewandowski told CNN, “Nobody’s condoning violence. Mr. Trump would never condone violence …We would never condone violence.”

Yet Lewandowski yanked Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields’ arm and nearly threw her to the ground Saturday night when Fields attempted to ask Trump a question. Fields’ boyfriend, Daily Caller reporter Jamie Weinstein, was furious, remarking that Trump surrounded himself with thugs:

Trump always surrounds himself w thugs. Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski tried to pull my gf @MichelleFields to ground when she asked tough q — Jamie Weinstein (@Jamie_Weinstein) March 9, 2016

This wasn’t the first time Lewandowski’s violent attitude toward women has surfaced; last August, after Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked Trump hard questions during a debate, Trump supporters targeted Kelly, and Michael Cohen, an advisor to Trump, went so far as to retweet from an account named “surfersfortrump” that said, “#boycottmegynkelly @realDonaldTrump we can gut her.” He said at the time, “I didn’t and don’t believe that the tweet implied physical violence against Ms. Kelly.""

Lewandowski had no problem remembering the vitriol directed toward Kelly, apparently using it as a threat five months later. In January, when Trump dodged a Fox debate in Iowa, Fox News revealed that Lewandowski threatened Kelly, stating of Trump’s dodge:

We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage. Capitulating to politicians’ ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly. In a call on Saturday with a FOX News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a ‘rough couple of days after that last debate’ and he ‘would hate to have her go through that again.’ Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats, but he continued to do so. We can’t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees.

As Katy Tur of NBC noted:

As far as Lewandowski’s apparent win-at-all-costs attitude which he feels gives him license to cheat, he has reportedly repeatedly ignored debate rules precluding candidates from consulting with their staff during breaks in the debate, even going so far as brazenly walking on stage to advise Trump during a break. In that case, he was even advised by Fox News to leave, but refused.

Kadir Akçaalan, founder of the Ottoman Janissary band ‘Mehter’, explained that this summer they intend to start practicing several pieces from the Alexandrov Ensemble’s repertoire.

As he explained during his interview with Sputnik Turkiye, the band intends to perform these pieces to pay tribute to the members of the Alexandrov Ensemble who were killed during a plane crash on December 25, 2016.

Akçaalan also added that if Mehter is invited to participate in the upcoming 2017 Spasskaya Tower military music festival, then “it would be a great honor to pay respects to our dear friends from the Ensemble in Russia, their home country.”

As Akçaalan explained, the band hasn’t yet received an official invitation to the festival but will definitely accept one if the offer is made.

“After last year’s tragic plane crash, participating in the festival would hold an even greater meaning for our band, giving us a chance to pay our respects to the members of Alexandrov Ensemble and its head Valery Khalilov who were killed in the crash… We would be delighted to visit Russia and to pay our respects to our friends from the Ensemble in their home country,” he said.

It should be noted that the Mehter Janissary Band had already participated in the Spasskaya Tower festival in 2014, only two years after the band itself was founded.

""We were pleasantly surprised and touched by the genuine interest towards us shown by Russian audience and officials alike. We’ve toured many countries by now, but we’ve never experienced such joy and interest like what we felt at that festival in Russia,"" Akçaalan said.

Speaking about his experience during the 2014 festival, he also remarked that the Spasskaya Tower fest is not just a martial music event, but that it also helps bring together different cultures, creating a unique sense of camaraderie between the participants.

""When we were performing our country’s musical compositions, other participants were joining us and vice versa. The limitless world of art brought us together. The festival gave representatives of various nations a chance to meet each other,"" Akçaalan declared.

The Spasskaya Tower festival is an annual music fiesta staged in front of the historic fortified complex in the heart of Moscow. For a week Moscow’s Red Square will be transformed into a stage for some of the world’s best military and classical musicians performing live for an audience of thousands near the Kremlin’s iconic Spasskaya Tower.

Democrats and their mainstream media cohorts are very concerned about Russia these days. So much so, that they've completely ignored the fact that former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton facilitated the sale of 20 percent of our nation's uranium to the Russia-government backed company, Uranium One. They also ignored the fact that the Podesta Group (founded by Hillary's campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, Tony) was paid by Russia's largest bank to lobby against Russia-sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.

They're also ignoring the fact that the Russian ambassador who met with AG Jeff Sessions while he served as senator, also met with members of Hillary Clinton's campaign team, too. From The Hill:

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said in an interview Sunday that the Russian ambassador who met with Trump campaign officials also met with “people working in think tanks advising Hillary or advising people working for Hillary.” “Well, if you look at some people connected with Hillary Clinton during her campaign, you would probably see that he had lots of meetings of that kind,” Dmitry Peskov told CNN “GPS” host Fareed Zakaria. “There are lots of specialists in politology, people working in think tanks advising Hillary or advising people working for Hillary.” Peskov said it is the job of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to meet with officials on both sides to talk about “bilateral relations.” Peskov also defended those meetings, saying they were not an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election. “But there were no meetings about elections — electoral process … So if you look at it with intention to demonize Russia, you would probably say that, yes, he was trying to interfere in Hillary's activities. But it would be nonsense, because this is not true,” Peskov said.

Peskov reminded that Putin never vocalized support for Trump during the presidential campaign:

“You would probably recall that President Putin, during election campaign, had never answered directly a question about his candidate of his support. He kept saying that we will respect a choice of American people,” Peskov told Zakaria. Peskov, did however, concede that Putin preferred Trump over Clinton, saying, “If you ask him whether he had mentioned the then-candidate Donald Trump, I will answer, yes, he had.”

Peskov suggested that the Kremlin leader found Clinton hostile toward Russia, while Trump was open to thawing U.S.-Russian relations.

""The candidate Hillary Clinton was quite negative about our country in her attitude and in her program, declaring Russia being nearly the main evil in the world and the main threat for the United States,"" Peskov said.

""And to the contrary, the other candidate, Donald Trump, was saying that, 'Yes, we disagree with the Russians ... in lots of issues, but we have to talk to them in order to try to find some understanding.' Whom would you like better? The one who says that Russia is evil or the one who says that, 'Yes, we disagree, but let's talk to understand and to try to find some points of agreement?'"" he asked.

More than a week after Instagram deleted a post from megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant for not ""promoting harmony"" because he urged a boycott of Swedish clothing retail giant H&M over racist advertising, an official from Facebook, which owns the application, said it was a ""mistake.""

""We mistakenly removed the content and worked to rectify the mistake as soon as we were notified,"" an Instagram spokesperson told The Christian Post in a statement late Thursday.

The Empowerment Temple church leader and social activist revealed in a video he posted on his Facebook page on Jan. 8 that he took umbrage to H&M's use of a black boy to model a sweatshirt with the slogan ""Coolest monkey in the jungle"" that was featured on the company's U.K. website and decided to join in a growing protest against the company for their insensitivity.

""I immediately at 6 o'clock this morning (Jan. 8) en route to the gym, posted on Instagram. That every person who is of conscience no matter what your color, should in fact be boycotting H&M because they do not appreciate our dollars and don't understand our depth and don't think highly enough of us to put us on their board of directors. #boycottH&M,"" Bryant said in the video.

Facebook also never had an African-American on its board until it announced Thursday that it will bring Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express, onto its board.

After about 4,000 people had approved his message on the social platform, Bryant said Instagram sent him a note saying: ""We have taken the liberty to delete your post because it does not promote harmony.""

A more diplomatic version of Bryant's controversial post is currently live on his Instagram page.

Many high profile public figures such as NBA star LeBron James and rapper Diddy have voiced their disapproval of the H&M advertisement. Singer Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as ""the Weeknd,"" has canceled his partnership with the company.

There has been intense global backlash over the advertising. At least two H&M outlets in South Africa were trashed by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party during anti-racism protests that forced the company to close all of its stores in that country on Saturday.

A Fortune report said the company announced Annie Wu as their new global leader for diversity and inclusiveness on Tuesday. She was already the global manager for employee relations.

""The recent incident was entirely unintentional, but it demonstrates so clearly how big our responsibility is as a global brand,"" H&M said in a message on Instagram. ""Our commitment to addressing diversity and inclusiveness is genuine, therefore we have appointed a global leader, in this area, to drive our work forward.""

Bryant charged, however, that despite the company's apology, it has no real commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Don't walk away from H&M just for today. Shut the door,"" he told his supporters. ""Save your apology H&M. The reason why it is that you are able to do it with clear conscience is that you are developing, you are manufacturing, you are warehousing, you are shipping all at the hands of black people but on your board of 12, you have not one minority sitting on your board.""",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Instagram 'Mistakenly' Deleted Pastor Jamal Bryant's Post Urging H&M Boycott, Company Says",,,[''],"More than a week after Instagram deleted a post from megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant for not ""promoting harmony"" because he urged a boycott of Swedish clothing retail giant H&M over racist advertising, an official from Facebook, which owns the application, said it was a ...",,,

There are compelling arguments for just dividing us into the red team and the blue team and leaving it at that for a while. The first is personal. Americans may not be thrilled about either of these presidential wannabes. But after all the money spent, time wasted and spin spun on a race that ended up basically in a tie, it seems kind of mean to make one guy lose.

Just as elementary school phys-ed now stresses circus arts or aerobic dancing rather than something overly competitive like dodgeball, it seems heartless to say one candidate gets all those great White House parties and perks and the other just goes home to sulk. Especially when we're told that one guy wants it so much and the other guy's family holidays will be ruined forever if he loses. The ''Odd Couple'' scenario on ''Saturday Night Live'' -- let them serve together -- would be a cruel hoax. An honest resolution would give them each his own country.

The political logic is impeccable. Though the candidates did their best to straddle the middle, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the race was about a cultural divide in American life more than one over narrow issues. You think all this hysteria is over which prescription drug policy gets adopted?

So Mr. Bush's voters could have a country with a weak federal government, modest social services, all the guns you want, no abortion, the death penalty, prayer in school and much talk about conservative values. Mr. Gore's voters could have one with a strong federal government, aggressive social programs, few guns, legalized abortion, no death penalty (or at least a high bar for invoking it), no prayer in school and much talk about inclusion and multiculturalism. The Democrats want to soak the rich a bit more? Have at it. The Republicans are sick of meddling courts and judges (except when they rule their way)? Who says two branches of government couldn't work as well as three?

When one contemplates the political discourse over the next few years, disunion is a slam dunk. Does anyone really think that Tom DeLay, Dick Armey and Jesse Helms are going to find common ground with David Bonior, Hillary Clinton and Barney Frank? They don't belong in the same country, let alone the same legislature. Why not separate them before someone really gets hurt?

The Republicans have their base in the South. They swept it again, give or take a few butterfly ballots and dimpled chads. They nominate their president every four years in the primary in South Carolina, the state that started all the fun back in Secession I. Mr. Bush could, of course, set up shop in Montgomery or Richmond, the way they did last time, but staying in Austin would allow him to sleep in his own bed with his own pillow and drive over to whack weeds over at the the ranch whenever he pleases.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Democrats have their base in the Northern states that took on secession last time. Washington worked fine for Mr. Lincoln, so it should work for Mr. Gore as well.

Now, as George C. Scott said when facing nuclear annihilation in ''Dr. Strangelove,'' ''I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed up.'' Gerrymandering the Republican nation to take in the South and most of the nation's heartland, the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states, seems a piece of cake, but figuring out a contiguous Democratic map with the Northeast, Great Lakes states, California and Pacific Northwest might take a little work.

And, of course, many states (Wisconsin and Florida come to mind) are as divided as the nation as a whole, which leaves any state-by-state realignment imperfect. And then there are those pesky Naderites. It's not likely that Ralph Nader and his pristine band would settle for a county or two in Oregon, but that could be negotiated.

WHO gets Alan Greenspan? What about the Southern blacks now stuck in Dixie II or Republican-leaning states like New Hampshire and Ohio left like orphans at the mercy of their Democratic neighbors? Who gets to use Air Force One and play ''Hail to the Chief''? Would Nafta apply to New York companies operating in Georgia? Would it be inherently destabilizing to have the entire pundit class in one country and all the missiles and space technology in the other?

Most important, would this divestiture be bullish or bearish for stocks?

Difficult questions all. But if we do this right we could still share the things we're civil about -- Yankees versus Braves, Cowboys versus Giants, Backstreet Boys versus 'N Sync, a new season of ''Survivor'' -- while agreeing to disagree in our separate political kingdoms.

And maybe it doesn't have to be permanent. Think of it as a time out for a 3-year-old. If one side decides it misses the other after all, like the mismatched lovers in a Meg Ryan movie, we could reunite in time for the Hillary Clinton-Jeb Bush race a few years down the road.",2018-02-11 00:35:33.803595,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Bench Mark: Divided We Stand; If at First You Don't Secede . . .,Peter Applebome,,"['BUSH  GEORGE W', 'GORE  AL', 'UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT', 'ELECTION ISSUES', 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2000']","Close presidential election has exposed deep cultural divide in American life and, whichever candidate ultimately wins, political discourse over next few years is likely to continue to reflect disunion on broad array of issues; map (M)",,,nytimes

By better understanding the other signs, and their basic traits, we can also understand the type of person we are dealing with.

And if you weren’t born yesterday, it’s likely that you have met some pretty dishonest and fake people within your lifetime. Of course, these aren’t the worst people in the world, but they can be just as toxic within your life. So which zodiac signs are the most genuine and honest, and which ones are completely on the other side of the scale? Well, I am glad you asked.

If any sign from the entire zodiac is known for their complete honesty, it is the Sagittarius. Actually, the Sagittarius believes in morality and is against lying so very much that they may even offend you with how honest they are. While it may come off as brutal, they truly only mean the best.

2. Aries

Similar to the Sagittarius, the Aries is a sign of brutal honesty. If you do something stupid, they will tell you, with no holds barred. However, while the Sagittarius means well, the Aries is a little more offensive about it. But, don’t take it too hard, as it is just a major aspect of their personality.

3. Aquarius

Aquarius could possibly be considered one of the most genuine signs of the zodiac. Their honesty is rooted in their desire to be themselves, and due to this, they refuse to tell anything but the truth. Thankfully, in contrast to the Aries and Sagittarius, they are a bit more kind about it.

4. Libra

Libras are very passionate individuals with a high-level of morality. If they feel strongly about someone or something, they will become the most driven individuals in the zodiac. Because of this, they are also one of the most genuine.

Because of Capricorn’s very strong self-discipline, they are known for coming through on their word. To the Capricorn, their word should mean something and they will stop and nothing to make sure that it remains as so.

6. Cancer

Not only do Cancers say what they feel, but they also are able to maintain deep emotional bonds with other people, which they feel are truly important to them on a major level. Because of this, the Cancer lives their life as ethically as possible.

7. Scorpio

While Scorpio is one of the most loyal signs of the zodiac, they are also known for their honesty. However, while they are loyal and honest, their passion for others can also cause them to come off as jealous or possessive.

8. Leo

Leos, similar to Capricorns regard themselves highly and have much self respect. While they won’t outright tell a major lie, embellishing the truth is not beyond their scope of capability.

9. Pisces

As an intuitive sign, Pisces also has a sense of exactly how much they can get away with or what is better to keep hidden from the general public. Similar to Leos, they won’t tell an outright lie, but they will bend the truth a bit to protect themselves or others.

10. Taurus

The Taurus is a sign that can be a bit split. While they will readily provide you with factual information, they may censor themselves from telling the entire truth, or hold back entire scenarios for their own benefit.

11. Virgo

Virgo and Gemini are tied for the most dishonest. While Virgo can be a stickler in many ways, their overactive imaginations can lead to various lies. Sometimes, they may not even intend to lie to you, however, their imaginations kick in and create scenarios that aren’t entirely true.

12. Gemini

Finding themselves at the bottom of this list, it has been said that you can tell if a Gemini is lying by whether or not their mouth is moving. Furthermore, the Gemini will not only lie continuously, they may even lose track of their lies, leading to more and more lies until they are caught.

Simple text version follows

Allegation of Improprieties in the Procurement and Installation of a Radar System at Pristina Airport (Case 217-04) I. Introduction 1. When conducting investigations into alleged wrongdoings at the ""Public Enterprise Airport Pristina"" (PEAP) pursuant to UNMIK Executive Decision No. 2003/16, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) received an allegation of improprieties during the procurement process and installation of a new radar system at the Airport. The allegations contended that PEAP management, in particular the official of Pristina Airport, had unduly delayed the radar installation process and agreed to cover the costs for the extension of the interim solution for the radar system, thus incurring additional costs of 570,500. II. Background Information 2. As a consequence of the implementation of Security Council Resolution No. 1244 (1999), UNMIK took over the administration of Pristina Airport. Effective 1 July 2002, the authority over civil aviation was passed from Pillar II to Pillar IV. At this point in time NATO had already advised UNMIK that by the end of July 2002, NATO would withdraw the Italian contingent that was running the Airport. As Kosovo is landlocked and transportation through Serbia is currently impeded, it was obvious from UNMIK's point of view that the Airport had to be kept operational. It was also clear that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) would only approve operations at Pristina Airport if basic requirements of safety and control were met. 3. Therefore, at a NATO meeting in Berlin in late 2002, it was agreed that Iceland should be the lead nation for operations at PEAP. The interim period of NATO member states running Pristina Airport was fixed for 18 months until 1 April 2004. Accordingly, SRSG/UNMIK and KFOR signed an agreement covering KFOR operations at the Airport including fire brigade, security, safety and a radar system provided by the Italian Air Force (IAF). 4. In 2003 the Civil Aviation Regulatory Office (CARO) was created by UNMIK Regulation No. 2003/18 in close cooperation with the Technical Cooperation Bureau (TCB) within ICAO. CARO was tasked to cover � inter alia � specific projects where UNMIK/KTA intended to benefit from the knowledge and experience of ICAO. The radar procurement was one of these projects. 5. As NATO had agreed to run the operations at PEAP only until 1 April 2004, UNMIK CARO was compelled to look for an operational and technical replacement after 1 April ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2 2004. One area concerned was the radar as it was foreseeable that the Italians would withdraw their personnel and equipment as of 1 April 2004. Consequently, UNMIK concluded a contract with ICAO on 4 April 2003 whereby ICAO undertook the procurement services for the purchase of surveillance radar equipment on behalf of UNMIK. ICAO was to be reimbursed with an amount equal to 4% of the contract sum. 6. As of 1 April 2004, the Airport was transferred from military to civil administration. Since CARO, the responsible body within UNMIK, was unable to monitor the air space of Kosovo in the way sovereign states monitor their air space, UNMIK and Iceland agreed that from 1 April 2004 onwards, the Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration (ICAA) would take over the functions of a sovereign state regarding Kosovo airspace and CARO would certify ICAA decisions on behalf of UNMIK. Subsequently, ICAA officials including Official 2 and Official 1 and a former official of Pillar IV, assumed advisory functions at Pristina Airport. III. Applicable Law PROVISIONAL CRIMINAL CODE OF KOSOVO (PCCK) Article 233 - Irresponsible Economic Activity (1) A responsible person within a business organization or legal person who, by consciously violating the law or other provision relating to business activities, acts in an irresponsible way and thereby causes substantial material damage to the business organization or legal person shall be punished by a fine or by imprisonment up to three years.

IV. Methodology 7. ITF Investigators collected and analyzed all relevant documents from PEAP and KTA and interviewed all relevant persons involved in the radar procurement pursuant to Executive Decision No. 2003/16. V. Investigative Details 8. ICAO conducted a tendering exercise for the radar system on 25 June 2003 and subsequently held a technical meeting with potential bidders at Pristina Airport on 28 and 29 July 2003. Three companies submitted bids, namely Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3. ICAA Official 1 advised the ITF on 17 May 2005 that approximately 12 � 18 months is required to install and adjust a new radar system. As demanded by UNMIK, ICAO requested all bidders to detail the costs and availability of an interim solution until the new radar system is installed. Vendor 3 offered an interim solution for a period of 38 weeks starting with the entry into force of the contract at a price of 180,000, while Vendor 1 proposed leasing a mobile system for one (1) year at a cost of 950.000. Vendor 2 did not provide any solution for an interim system due to a concentration on supplying and achieving operational status of the new system by 1 April 2004. 9. Consequently, Vendor 3 was awarded the contract and on 29 October 2003, ICAO on behalf of UNMIK and Vendor 3 concluded a contract stipulating an interim period of 38 weeks starting with the entry into force of the contract on 11 December 2003. Attachment II of the contract determined that Vendor 3 was to be paid 180,000 for the interim solution. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4 10. ITF Investigators established from paragraphs 4.1.7 and 9.1.1 of the ""Contract No. 30618 for the Provision of a PSR and MSSR for UNMIK � Pristina Airport"" concluded by ICAO on behalf of UNMIK and Vendor 3 that ""the contractor shall guarantee full operational and technical performance of an interim radar system (at least at the same level as the one existing at Pristina Airport) during the whole implementation time of this contract so that the Pristina Airport will not suffer a lack of ATC services until the successful installation of the new radar system. In this connection, UNMIK/ICAO shall submit an application to the Italian Air Force Headquarters for an extension of the period of availability of the existing radar during the implementation time of the contract."" 11. Paragraph 9.1.1 determines that ""The Contract Implementation shall not exceed thirty- eight (38) weeks from the date of coming into force of this Contract."" As the contract came into force on 11 December 2003 the interim solution was scheduled to end on 2 September 2004. Attachment II of the contract states that the cost for the contract implementation will be 180,000 or approximately 20,000 per month. 12. ITF Investigators obtained the original technical specifications of the tender, which specified in paragraph 8.1. ""the tenderer shall determine the best location for the radar and shelter within the Pristina Airport Terminal Area, in order to satisfy the technical and operational requirements requested in these specifications."" 13. All parties involved, including PEAP Official 2, ICAA official 2, ICAA Official 1, Vendor 3 Representative as well as FAX- correspondence from the Official of the Technical Co-operation Bureau, ICAO addressed to relevant UNMIK departments, dated 11 February 2004, confirmed that as early as January/February 2004, deliberations had started to relocate the radar site from the Pristina Terminal Area to the nearby Golesh Mountain, granting much wider visibility and coverage of Western Kosovo territory. ICAA Official 2 stated that the coverage of Western Kosovo was essential under safety considerations. In 1999, an UNHCR plane had crashed into the mountains surrounding Pristina as radar coverage at that time was insufficient. ICAA Official 2 stressed the need for air safety as per the ICAO requirements. 14. When asked why they had not introduced these deliberations of better safety and wider coverage at an earlier stage, the PEAP Official 2, as well as ICAA Official 1 and Official 2 stated that ICAO drew up the specifications and they were not involved in this process. ITF did not find any countervailing evidence as ICAA Official 2 became involved in the process only in January 2004 and both PEAP Official 2 and ICAA Official 1 are not radar experts. It was precisely for this reason that ICAO � the experts in the field of air safety � were contracted by UNMIK to draw up the specifications and conduct of the radar procurement. 15. When ICAO was asked by ICAA and PEAP whether it was possible to amend the specifications in light of ICAA Official 2's recommendations, ICAO responded that it was possible. However, ICAO made it clear from the beginning and throughout the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5 entire installation process (Fax from 11 February 2004 to UNMIK representatives) that the relocation of the radar site would delay the installation of the radar and consequently lead to additional costs, as the interim solution would most likely have to be extended. 16. PEAP Official 2, who was responsible for the radar project on behalf of PEAP management, as well as ICAA Official 1 and Official 2, confirmed that they were aware of potential additional costs. However, ICAA Official 1 and Official 2 emphasized that for safety reasons, this was the preferable solution. Moreover, ICAA Official 2 questioned whether the interim period of 38 weeks originally negotiated by ICAO was sufficiently protecting the needs of UNMIK as, in his view, the installation of a new radar system takes from twelve to eighteen months normally. 17. As a consequence of the envisaged change of the location site, in March 2004, PEAP/ICAA mandated three companies, Vendor 3, Vendor 4 and Vendor 5, to conduct feasibility studies regarding the radar site at Golesh Mountain declared that the relocation would be possible but would cause additional costs of approx. 2.5 million. Vendor 5 and Vendor 4 listed the advantages and inconvenience of each solution - the principal advantage of the site at Golesh Mountain was the wider visibility, but the main disadvantage was the fact that this site was not easily accessible in winter and would not cover the immediate approach of airplanes to Pristina Airport below 500 feet. 18. At this point, the civil works for the radar installation at the Terminal site had come to a halt due to the uncertainty of the radar location. Vendor 3 Representative stated that correspondence had been sent from ICAO to Vendor 3 requesting Vendor 3 not to proceed with any civil works for the radar installation at Pristina Airport until further notice was received from ICAO. This information is confirmed in an e-mail from an ICAO Staff Member dated 23 March 2004 addressed to UNMIK and Airport representatives. 19. ICAA Official 1 told ITF Investigators that ICAO was exerting considerable pressure on ICAA and PEAP management to abstain from the Golesh Mountain radar site location. He/she stated that ICAO was trying to avoid conflicts with Serbia, as the Golesh location would allow scrutiny of Serbian territory. Given the political situation in Kosovo/Serbia, this would have created additional tension, which ICAO attempted to avoid. 20. On 24 June 2004, the then UNMIK Pillar IV Senior Official, sent a letter to an Official of the Technical Co-operation Bureau, ICAO, confirming that the radar should be located at the Airport site as originally suggested by the supplier Vendor 3. On 6 July 2004, PEAP Official 2 sent an e-mail on behalf of ICAA and Airport Management to ICAO, ICAA, Vendor 3, UNMIK � CARO about the final decision of the location of the new radar. Referring to the e-mail it was agreed that the radar site location should ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6 be at the Terminal site as ICAO had requested ""an approach radar"" covering the immediate approach of aircraft to Pristina Airport. It was also agreed that the Airport should procure a secondary radar, with narrower coverage, and position it at Golesh Mountain. Such action addressed the ICAA's safety concern that better coverage for the western sector of Pristina Airport was required. 21. ICAA Official 2 told ITF Investigators that this secondary radar was easily installed and that it was also able to provide the entire Airport with sufficient radar coverage for a limited interim period � thereby easing the pressure on the Airport regarding the extension of the interim solution. However, during the procurement for the secondary radar, PEAP management discovered that the three companies that submitted bids were in fact all subsidiaries of one and the same company. Therefore, this tender had to be re-issued in August 2004, thus adding to the delay of the radar solution. 22. ITF Investigators were able to establish from the parties concerned � except Vendor 3 � that a failed Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) by Vendor 3 in May 2004 added to the delay. However, according to all persons involved in this process, Vendor 3 was able to conduct a successful FAT in July 2004. The indications as to how much of the delay was attributable to Vendor 3 vary from no time at all to two months at the most. Moreover, it has to be taken into account that the delay of the FAT occurred during the exact time period when civil works for the radar at Pristina Airport had been put on hold anyway due to the uncertainty as to the radar location. 23. PEAP Steering Committee meeting minutes of 23 September 2004 and e-mail correspondence from ICAO dated 15 September 2004 show that Airport management was trying to find a solution for the delay of the installation of the radar system caused by the feasibility studies on the radar location and the failed FAT test. ICAA Offical 1 and ICAA Official 2 stated that PEAP Official 2 � when launching the tender for the secondary radar � was still confident a timely solution would be found, thus avoiding an extension of the Italian KFOR radar beyond September 2004. 24. However, since the expiration date of the interim solution was fast approaching and the secondary radar was not ready due to the delayed procurement process, PEAP, ICAA and Vendor 3 agreed to extend the interim solution deadline. Vendor 3 then demanded a monthly rental fee of 101,500 instead of the original 20,000 per month. Vendor 3 provided a breakdown of its costs and referred to the fact that since 1 April 2004 � when the Italian Air Force had left Pristina Airport � Vendor 3 had to provide for personnel and maintenance of the radar. 25. ITF Investigators found that the monthly rental rate for the radar of 20,000 was an unusually reasonable rate mainly due to the fact that Vendor 3 had benefited from its links to the Italian Air Force to be able to offer a cheap interim solution in order to bolster its bid. In fact, Vendor 1, the only competitor who offered an interim solution as well, gave the price of their interim solution at 950,000 for a one-year-period. Furthermore, ITF Investigators obtained correspondence from ICAO to PEAP ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7 management, dated 24 September 2004, stating that 95,000 was a fair market price for an interim radar. 26. PEAP management and ICAA then tried to lower the monthly rate quoting a draft memo from Representative of Vendor 5, Vendor 5, dated 15 September 2004, and referring to the lower rate of 20,000. However, Vendor 3 continued to refer to the reasons for the costs incurred since the departure of the Italian KFOR operating the radar and the unusually low price. The parties then agreed on a monthly rate of 81,500 scheduled to be paid for seven months from 15 October 2004 until 15 May 2005 for a total of 570,500. The first two weeks of October 2004 were to be provided free of charge by Vendor 3. 15 May 2005 was set as the final implementation date. 27. All parties interviewed by ITF Investigators stated that this agreement was � at least to a large extent � based on the fact that PEAP/ICAA exclusively relied on the interim radar to continue services at the Airport. PEAP Official 2 relied exclusively on the interim solution and only took measures to ensure an alternative option for the radar system in August 2004 when the interim solution was due to expire on 12 September 2004. Moreover, PEAP Official 2 � in conjunction with ICAA Official 1 and ICAA Official 2, pushed for an alternative radar location, thereby aggravating the time constraints regarding the interim solution. 28. All relevant parties interviewed by ITF Investigators stated that until February 2005 no payments were made by PEAP. PEAP Official 3 did not see any justification for the payment because, from his/her point of view: a) the extension of the rental of the interim system is considered to be an amendment to the original contract and should be signed the same way; b) the price level agreed upon for the extension of the rental is outrageous, compared to the price for the period of thirty-eight (38) weeks; c) as of 11 February 2005, she had not seen the new contract. Vendor 3 then threatened PEAP that unless payments were made, they would turn off the radar. Under pressure from Vendor 3, on 10 February 2005, an agreement was signed that stated: ""The delay is accepted due to the fact of delayed decision on Radar Site Location and severe weather conditions at Pristina Airport."" 29. ICAA Official 1 and ICAA Official 2 stated that even though Vendor 3 might have been responsible for up to two months of the delay, ICAA, as well as PEAP, were compelled to sign this agreement. This resulted from the fact that Vendor 3 threatened to turn the radar off and would not accept any weaker wording in the agreement given the fact that no money had been transferred to Vendor 3 for the interim solution. Vendor 3 Representative told ITF Investigators that the wording ""severe weather conditions"" was meant to express the hardship of building the civil works for the radar at Pristina Airport in winter times rather than in spring or summer. 30. Consequently, PEAP Official 1, in his capacity as ""A"" signatory, authorised the payments on 11 February 2005 for the following invoices: No. 40002, period 1 October � 31 October 2004; No. 40003, period 1 November � 30 November 2004; No. 40005, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8 period 1 December � 31 December 2004; and No. 50002 � period 1 January � 31 January 2005 in the sum of 326.000. The remaining invoices for the months of February, March, April and May 2005 are still outstanding. VI. Findings 31. The ITF found that the delay incurred by the search for a new radar location can be explained by safety concerns as specified by Official 1 and Official 2 of ICAA. 32. The ITF found that the price negotiated by PEAP Official 2, ICAA Official 1 and ICAA Official 2 for the extension of the interim solution was a reasonable market price � as stated by ICAO. 33. The ITF found that PEAP Official 2 did not approach Vendor 3 in a timely manner to ask for an extension of the interim solution of the radar, nor did he/she attempt to find an alternative solution for the Vendor 3 radar when he/she saw that the procurement of the secondary radar would be delayed. VII. Conclusions 34. The ITF concludes that PEAP Official 2 did not violate any pertinent Rules or Regulations as to his/her failure to improve PEAP's negotiation position, nor does his/her failure to act amount to ""irresponsible economic activity"" or ""entering into a harmful contract"" under PCCK. 35. The ITF concludes that PEAP Official 2's failure to exhaust all possible means to find an alternative option for the interim solution of the radar constitutes a ""repeated mistake"" under section 11.4 of UNMIK Regulation No. 2001/27 in the context of the findings and conclusions of previous investigations conducted by the ITF, most notably in Case No. 352/04, issued to the SRSG/UNMIK on 05 January 2005. VIII. Recommendations 36. As a result of this investigation, ITF recommends the following: Recommendation 1: The ITF recommends that UNMIK Pillar IV take into account the above findings and conclusions when taking appropriate action against PEAP Official 2 according to ITF report 352/04 submitted to the SRSG on 05 January 2005 and any other report submitted by the ITF (IV/04/217/01). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9 Recommendation 2: The ITF recommends that UNMIK Pillar IV advise all senior POE managers that, during the establishment of the terms of contracts, the need for the inclusion of specific terms to enable contract extensions be given careful consideration, particularly in the case of interim solution contracts for equipment purchases and/or replacement (IV/04/217/02). -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",2017-11-13T18:09:27.760857,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo: Allegation of Improprieties in the Procurement and Installation of a Radar System at Pristina Airport (ID Case No. 217-04), 1 Jan 2004",,,"['United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo: Allegation of Improprieties in the Procurement and Installation of a Radar System at Pristina Airport (ID Case No. 217-04)', '1 Jan 2004', 'WikiLeaks', 'Follow', 'United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services', 'International organization', 'What makes a proper leak descriptor']",,,,

The Democratic presidential primary truly began on Saturday night. The vanity candidates had dropped out and the three remaining candidates took the stage at the Iowa Democratic party’s Jefferson-Jackson dinner, eager to impress 6,000 voters at Hy-Vee Hall in downtown Des Moines.

Related: Sanders tears into Clinton’s ambitions and record at Iowa Democrat fundraiser

The Jefferson-Jackson dinner has long been one of the most important events on the Democratic calendar. Every four or eight years, this annual fundraising gala becomes the pre-eminent Democratic presidential cattle call.

In 2007, an electrifying speech at the event from senator Barack Obama was credited as a turning point in his epic primary battle against Hillary Clinton. In 2003, John Kerry began his march to the nomination with a speech touting himself as “the real deal”. As far back as 1975, Jimmy Carter used a straw poll held at the event back to catapult himself to front of the pack.

This year, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders energized the crowd when he gave his strongest critique yet of Clinton’s candidacy and record. Echoing Obama’s subtle criticism of Clinton in his 2007 speech, Sanders said: “I promise you tonight, as your president I will govern based on principle not poll numbers.”

Sanders received a rapturous reception from a raucous crowd, including supporters who spent his entire speech cheering and applauding.

The self-identified democratic socialist explicitly compared himself to Obama. He said: “Eight years ago, the experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president, Barack Obama, couldn’t win. How he was unelectable.

“Well, Iowa, I think we’re going to prove the pundits wrong again. I believe we will make history.”

Implicitly, Sanders went on to call Clinton out, noting she had long lagged behind him on a number of progressive causes. In particular, he cited gay rights, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and the Iraq war as “the difficult choices” – a subtle reference to Clinton’s recent memoir of her time as secretary of state, Hard Choices – that he had made.

The question is whether offering such a critique of his rival, combined with touting his volunteer numbers and donations, will resonate with undecided voters.

Clinton gave a workmanlike speech, in which she bashed Republicans and seemed unaware there was a primary on. She pondered if one qualification to be a Republican presidential candidate was to enter a time machine and travel 50 years into the past. She drew her most positive response from the crowd when she discussed abortion, saying: “For people who claim they hate big government, Republicans sure love using government to step in and make decisions for women.”

The former secretary of state didn’t need to hit the ball out of the park. In a room packed with supporters and coming off a strong performance in front of the House Benghazi committee , Clinton just needed a solid display. Many in the crowd held Styrofoam sticks that lit blue when she spoke and chanted along to lines in her speech.

Martin O’Malley, an underdog mired at 1% in polls, gave a strong speech too. Although the lines for the bathrooms grew markedly long as the former Maryland governor spoke, he drew strong applause at times, particularly when he went after the National Rifle Association as “craven and morally bankrupt”.

However, the ultimate testament to his speech came when a group of Sanders supporters briefly chanted “Sanders-O’Malley”. His is not a run for the vice-presidency, but it was a telling moment.

The event did not just focus on the speeches. Before the doors to the cavernous exhibition hall opened, all three candidates held rallies. Volunteers and staffers for each campaign spent hours waving signs to attract the attention of passing traffic. It was a political tailgate, before the big game.

The biggest rally saw thousands attend for Clinton, who was billed third behind both former President Bill Clinton, making his first appearance on the campaign trail, and pop star Katy Perry.

After Bill Clinton spoke for 15 minutes, Perry took the stage. She wore a tight white sequined dress, with the Hillary Clinton campaign logo over her heart, and a cape in the colors of the American flag. Perry began by singing her hit song Roar, then made a brief speech in support of Clinton before singing America the Beautiful. That segued into another hit song, Fireworks.

The candidate herself then made a brief appearance at her own rally. She spoke for about two minutes.

Sanders held a rally and march from the other side of the Des Moines River, over to the site of the dinner. The procession followed a rally the night before, 150 miles along the Mississippi River in Davenport. There, Sanders’s musical guests included members of MC5 and the punk-pop band Guster.

Saturday’s march featured hundreds of people tightly packed on a pedestrian bridge, accompanied by a marching band. Sanders stood at the front, part of a group holding a giant campaign banner, while supporters behind him displayed signs stating “the revolution is here” and “the revolution is now”.

Before the march, more than a hundred Sanders supporters stood outside the dinner venue, waving homemade signs – among the slogans was “Bernie Knows Quantum Physics” – and chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, the oligarchy has got to go”.

Many were clean-cut and earnest types in button-down shirts. But one young man with long purple hair, holding a megaphone, wore a Los Angeles Raiders hat – backwards – and a hunting vest.

O’Malley held the smallest-scale event, around a landscaped entrance to Hy-Vee Hall. His supporters waved signs like those of their rivals but as their numbers were smaller so were their signs.

As the tail end of a five-block line to attend the Clinton event stretched out, more than 100 O’Malley supporters cheered while waiting for their own special musical guest: the candidate himself. O’Malley has led a Baltimore “Celtic rock” bar band for more than a decade; on Saturday his campaign had their candidate strumming an acoustic guitar.

The main event, though, came down to a contrast between the raw and unpolished Sanders and the well-practiced Clinton. While Clinton’s celebrity guest, Katy Perry, sat in a front row table and was given a round of applause, Sanders’s own celebrity, MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer, sat anonymously in the bleachers.

Kramer told the Guardian: “I am supporting Bernie because he’s the only candidate that’s actually speaking to the actual challenges that the country faces.”

In Kramer’s opinion, the contrast between his music and that of Perry served as an analogue to the candidates they support.

“If you look at Katy Perry’s music, she’s auto-tuned and about as unauthentic as its possible to be,” Kramer said. “We, on the other hand, are sometimes out of tune, sometimes we sing flat, but we’re doing this with all our real heart and our minds.”

In reference to MC5’s most famous song, he added: “Bernie does kick out the jams.”

Geno Auriemma, coach of the UConn women's basketball team, will continue to appear as a spokesman for various companies, including Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, his face appearing in advertisements that assure readers, ''You don't have to be well-known to be recognized here,'' as long as his state employee status is not mentioned in the ad. Jim Calhoun, the men's basketball coach, will also continue with his advertising work, including being a spokesman for Webster Bank, his figure appearing on billboards throughout the greater Hartford area and on television.

But whether the coaches will be able to continue their contracts with Nike, the sports and fitness company, in which Nike supplied sneakers and uniforms to the teams, remained a question. Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Auriemma also received money, merchandise, equipment for their basketball camps and bonuses from Nike if their teams won national titles.

''Outside contracts are allowed under the law under certain conditions,'' said Helen Z. Pearl, chairwoman of the Organization and Policy Committee of the Ethics Commission. ''But there was a lot of misunderstanding. The statute does not ban outside contracts. Outside contracts are specifically allowed in the law as long as they don't interfere with professional judgment, confidentiality. If Geno doesn't trade on his state employment per se, even though everybody knows who he is, if he doesn't flaunt it, there may be no ethical objection to it. On the other hand, other things that tie bonuses to employment -- say if Nike outfits the team -- well then it depends.''

Monetary information regarding the contracts has been kept confidential. The coaches' compensation from UConn is public, however. Mr. Calhoun received a base salary of $200,000 for the 2004-5 academic year, increasing by $25,000 annually throughout the contract. He received an additional $1.2 million that year for institutional public relations commitments, including speaking engagements and appearances.

Mr. Auriemma received a base salary of $200,000 for the 2004-5 academic year, which increases by $25,000 annually. He also received $625,000 in the first year of the contract for institutional public relations commitments, which increases by $50,000 annually throughout the contract.

Both coaches are set to receive more money for additional services if UConn advances to postseason play, including one month of base salary if their respective teams play in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament or the National Invitation Tournament, or two months of base salary for an appearance in the N.C.A.A. Final Four.

Celebrity status was never written into the state statute regarding contracts involving state employees. Rather, it was created by the Ethics Commission about nine years ago when it was asked to issue advisory opinions on contracts regarding Dr. Henry Lee, the former director of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Crime Laboratory, Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Auriemma.

This year, when the Nike contracts were reported by The Hartford Courant, Gov. M. Jodi Rell requested a review of those agreements.

The commission said its decision would not be retroactive, meaning any existing contracts would remain in effect. Mr. Auriemma's contract with Nike runs through July 2010. Mr. Calhoun's contract with the company is set to expire in August.

724,7655045.0,naturalnews.com,junksci,https://naturalnews.com/2017-01-08-fitness-trackers-could-be-sending-your-data-to-healthcare-providers-bumping-up-your-premiums.html,"(Natural News) Fitness trackers like Fitbit pose a major privacy and security risk to users, warns a new report from the Centre for Digital Democracy.

Fitness trackers and smart watches, which are sold by companies including Fitbit, Apple, Jawbone, Misfit and Samsung, collect a wide range of personal, physical and health data about users. Companies could sell this information to advertisers, or even to your employer or health insurance provider. Users could suffer consequences ranging from targeted advertising to raised insurance premiums to job discrimination or even identity theft.

On top of which, there’s no evidence that the devices actually improve people’s health.

Treasure trove of data

The wearable devices monitor everything from physical activity to heart rate, sleep, stress levels and calorie consumption. As devices get more advanced, the information they collect becomes more and more valuable to malicious actors.

“Biosensors will routinely be able to capture not only an individual’s heart rate, body temperature, and movement, but also brain activity, moods, and emotions,” the report warns. “These data can, in turn, be combined with personal information from other sources—including health-care providers and drug companies—raising such potential harms as discriminatory profiling, manipulative marketing, and security breaches.”

The companies admit to collecting and analyzing user data — it’s part of the “service” provided — and to sharing it with third-party apps that users sign up for. Those third parties, in turn, may also pass along your data.

The first and most likely place for your data to end up is in the hands of advertisers. Targeted advertising using personal data has become big business in the age of the Internet. But there is also nothing to stop companies from selling your data to your health insurance company, which could use it to calculate increased premiums.

In fact, the list of companies and groups in the market for your private information is nearly endless.

The information collected by these devices “could enable profiling and discrimination—based on ethnicity, age, gender, medical condition, and other information—across a spectrum of fields, such as employment, education, insurance, finance, criminal justice, and social services, affecting not only individuals but also groups and society at large,” the report warns.

Even if a company promises never to share your data, the information could still be compromised by a cyber attack. Databases containing large amounts of diverse information, such as health care records, are now one of the favorite targets of malicious hackers.

“The opportunities for data breaches will increase, with hackers accessing medical and health information at insurance companies, retail chains, and other businesses,” the report says.

Do they even help?

Furthermore, studies now suggest that fitness trackers don’t actually lead to much improvement in exercise behaviors.

One study, published in the journal Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, found that people who used a Fitbit Zip for a year did show sustained increases in activity level, but only by an average of 16 minutes a week. This was “probably not enough to generate noticeable improvements in any health outcomes,” the researchers wrote.

It takes very little exercise — about 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three to five times a week — to dramatically improve your health profile. That is, 90 to 150 minutes a week. An extra 16 minutes isn’t enough to make much difference.

The researchers found no evidence that Fitbit wearers were any more likely to lose weight or improve cardiorespiratory fitness or blood pressure.

Another recent study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that people using wearable devices lose less weight than those using standard weight loss techniques.

8009,6016846.0,thesleuthjournal.com,unknown,http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/shia-muslims-fall-victims-deadly-attack-yemeni-capital/,"Months of latent sectarian tensions in the Yemeni capital, Sana’a came to a violent end this Monday afternoon at 1pm when unknown assailants targeted two men from the Shi’ite community at the well-known and popular Alghadir Library.

The two men have been identified as Amin Al Matadry and Mujahid Al Matary. Despite local residents efforts Amin immediately succumbed to his wounds. As for Mujahid, even though local police arranged his transfer to a nearby hospital, doctors were not able to save his life, due to the severity of his wounds.

Sheikh Salih Ayash told Shia Rights Watch how very shocked and saddened Sana’a Shia had been left to feel after such senseless and unwarranted attack. He was keen to stress that unlike what certain local media had reported on the attack, neither Al Matadry nor Al Matary were Houthi militants (northern Yemeni Shia group organized under the leadership of Sheikh Abdel-Malek Al Houthi).

He explained, “The media assumed both men were Houthi militants on account of their religious affiliation. It is not true, they had nothing to do with the Houthis … they were not affiliated to this faction.”

When asked by SRW how the Shia community was dealing with the situation, he stressed that most people felt fearful and anxious, “especially women and children.”

Because religious factions, mainly Salafis and Wahhabis in Yemen have been keen to play the sectarian card in order to forward their own personal political agenda, exploiting fear as well as social-religious intolerance to give their movement traction, Yemen Shia community has been left feeling somewhat ostracised and vulnerable.

An integral and important part of Yemen’ society, Yemen Shia community account for over 40% of the population, Shia Muslims cannot be made to become the victims of such targeted attacks, emphasised Sheikh Ayash, stressing “We as Yemenis need to stand together, equal in our rights and responsibilities, regardless of one’ sect, political affiliations or social background.”

Sana’a resident told SRW they were outraged. Several men from the Sunni community present at the scene of the shooting swore to stand by and protect their Shia neighbours from further attack if they had to.

Officials at the Interior Ministry confirmed they would be dealing with the matter with utmost diligence; affirming the state would not tolerate for dissident elements to threaten Yemen’ social cohesion through fear.

SRW which is concerned for the security of the Shia Muslim population in Yemen called on the Yemeni authorities to ensure that the Shia community, whose members are peace-loving and law abiding citizens are not made to live in a constant state of fear.

SRW categorically rejects and condemns any human rights violations.

Il ne s’agit pas de savoir si la guerre est réelle ou non. La victoire n’est pas possible. Il ne s’agit pas de gagner la guerre, mais de la prolonger indéfiniment.

Les sources du va-t-en-guerrisme sont invariables, mais leurs conséquences, effroyablement les mêmes. Que ce soit la perte de plus de 18,6 millions de vies humaines durant le premier conflit mondial, qui devait être la « Der des Ders », ou les 60 millions durant la suivante, l’humanité s’est fragmentée au grès des nationalismes bellicistes pour terminer en bains de sang dont le souvenir, de plus en plus flou, se résume à quelques noms : Verdun, Passchendaele, la Somme, Stalingrad, Hiroshima.

Or, l’histoire de la guerre ne se résume pas qu’à ces deux conflits, elle remonte aussi loin qu’à l’âge des chasseurs-cueilleurs. Le meurtre, le viol et la torture, toutes des manifestations de cette folie humaine qui s’enracine bien souvent dans la peur ou la convoitise. Un examen historique de nos sociétés révélerait que la condition humaine est indissociable à la guerre, et le conflit, caractéristique intrinsèque de cettedite condition. En d’autres mots, la guerre est une manifestation de notre humanité (ou l’inverse, qui est également vrai, bien qu’elle résulte sur des conclusions différentes).

En adoptant cette posture, nous pourrions résumer l’histoire humaine en un arrangement sonore : le sifflement des toutes premières flèches, le ferraillement des épées et des boucliers, le grondement des canons, la rafale des mitraillettes, le cliquetis des chaines des chars d’assaut. Le tout serait ponctué de silences. La mort. Ou plutôt les morts, qui tombent les uns sur les autres dans un mélange poussiéreux de morceaux de tissus, d’ossements et de terre — s’accumulant année après année, siècle après siècle, millénaire après millénaire. Hommes et femmes anonymes : nous ne savons rien d’eux, ni leur nom, ni leur âge, ni même leur passé. Étaient-ils jeunes ou vieux, amoureux ou esseulés, aimés, d’humeur joyeuse ou sombre, fils et filles de ou pères et mères de ? La guerre ne fait pas ces distinctions. Elle anonymise ceux qui ont vécu : ils deviennent des chiffres dans des archives nationales, au mieux. Les centaines, les milliers, les millions de morts. En somme, l’histoire de la guerre, c’est une histoire de chiffres. Dans les manuels d’histoire, ceux qui ont vécu n’ont pas leur place. Il n’y a que la mort, et le feu de la guerre qui consume chaque existence qui est sur son chemin.

945,2195452.0,lifezette.com,clickbait,https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/obama-scrambles-save-obamacare/print,"President Obama signaled his intent this week to become personally involved in coming Democratic efforts to save the Affordable Care Act from his successor’s promises to dismantle the widely unpopular law.

Obama will meet with congressional Democrats Wednesday to plot a strategy to protect his signature health care law when Congress convenes next week, a Capitol Hill source told Politico. The meeting reportedly will take place at 9 a.m. in the Congressional Visitors Center auditorium and includes both House and Senate participants.

“And one thing we have to do — repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.”

“Beginning in January, it is likely that Republican leaders in Congress will follow through on their threats to ram through a budget bill that will severely undermine the health care needs of the American people,” incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a “Dear Colleague” letter earlier this week.

“The Affordable Care Act has been successful in meeting its goals of reducing cost, increasing access and improving quality of care,” Pelosi added.

Despite the rhetoric emanating from Democratic camps, there has been little in the way of proposals from liberals to fix the aspects of the law hurting millions of Americans. Republicans have pledged to repeal the law that continues to drive premiums higher and restrict options and replace it with legislation preserving its most popular elements.

“Obamacare is just blowing up,” Donald Trump said during a press conference in late October. “Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced — otherwise this country is in bigger trouble than anybody thought.”

“Step one is the Obamacare replacement legislation at the start of the year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of congressional Republicans’ plans for the new year.

Just a few weeks before Election Day, news broke that Obamacare premiums would skyrocket to an average of a 22 percent increase across the country. In Oklahoma, premiums rose a staggering 76 percent.

""And one thing we have to do — repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare,"" Trump said during the final presidential debate in October. ""It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses — our small businesses and our big businesses.""",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,LifeZette Obama to Quarterback Efforts to Sabotage ACA Repeal,,,[''],,,,

But it was not your privacy or mine he was talking about. He has gone all out to keep his administration's energy-legislation deliberations from public scrutiny.

Cast your mind back to the White House task force, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, that came up with the stalled Bush oil policy. Democrats complained that it met frequently with Enron and other energy executives but blew off environmental lobbyists. Bush and Cheney, sensitive to charges of being too close to the oil industry, clammed up.

That secrecy violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, claimed the rightist Judicial Watch and the leftist Sierra Club as they sued for access. Cheney's lawyers dumped 30,000 pieces of wastepaper on them from around the bureaucracy, but not one memo produced by Cheney's group. Only federal officials were members of that task force, Bush lawyers argued, so advice from outside consultants is none of the public's business.

A federal court ruled against the stonewalling, and an appeals court let the ruling to allow discovery stand. But the administration escalated the case to ''the president's constitutional authority to gather candid advice from his advisers'' plus ''fundamental separation of powers questions.'' Up it went to the Supreme Court.

Mr. Hunter’s lawyers have said in court papers that after leaving the Army, he passed the entrance exam for the New York Police Department, but declined to pursue a job with the police because he felt the cost of living would have been too high in New York.

Mr. Hunter pleaded guilty in February to conspiring to murder the agent and the informer, to import cocaine into the United States and to possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. He could have received a maximum sentence of life in prison. Prosecutors had sought a sentence within the range stipulated in federal guidelines of about 24 to 30 years.

His lawyers had sought a 10-year sentence, the minimum he faced. They argued that Mr. Hunter had operated under duress while working as a mercenary for the South African businessman, Paul Le Roux, an international outlaw who had threatened to kill him if he did not follow his orders. (Mr. Le Roux was later arrested, and he has cooperated with the government.)

Marlon G. Kirton, a defense lawyer, suggested that Mr. Hunter, who he said had post-traumatic stress disorder, believed that he had no choice but to carry out Mr. Le Roux’s orders.

But prosecutors in the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, disputed that claim, arguing that Mr. Hunter knew Mr. Le Roux’s organization was involved in illegal activities, but nonetheless left the group and later rejoined it because he wanted to make money. “Greed, not duress” had led him to a courtroom, a prosecutor, Emil J. Bove III, said.

Judge Swain made it clear she agreed, noting that Mr. Hunter had associated himself with Mr. Le Roux voluntarily and had remained with him after becoming aware of, and involved in, his illegal activity.

“The safety of law enforcement agents, those helping them and of innocent people,” Judge Swain said, “depends on right choices, even if those choices are life or death choices.”

IN A FORMER REPUBLIC



by Harold Hunter



“I pledge allegiance to . . . the Republic . . . with liberty and justice for all.”

So we all say in that declaration which today is merely a pleasant anachronism. When the executive branch of our government is illegal yet is unstintingly supported by the legislative and judicial branches, the Republic itself and all its citizens suffer grave injustice.

We have an unprecedented constitutional crisis at the highest level of our government, yet Congress refuses to address it and our judges primly quote precedents about standing, jurisdiction and redressability, as if justice were merely a matter of legal scholarship. Wrong. To be just means to be fair, honorable, and morally right, and it is unfair to the people, dishonorable to the Constitution, and plainly immoral to permit Barack Obama to remain in the high office he wrongfully gained through election fraud.

Obama swore falsely when on November 30, 2007, he signed the Arizona “Candidate Nomination Paper” declaring “I am a natural born citizen of the United States.” Obama’s father was a British subject/citizen, so Barack’s birth status was governed by British law, an impossibility for a natural born U.S. citizen. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of our Constitution was specifically meant to bar anyone who held foreign or divided allegiance at birth from becoming Commander-in-Chief.

As Chair of the Democratic National Convention, Nancy Pelosi swore falsely when she officially certified that Obama was “legally qualified to serve under the provisions of the United States Constitution.” Shame on Pelosi in particular and Democrats in general. And shame on the Republicans for giving the fraud a pass.

So you can understand how I found it darkly humorous that Obama called Afghanistan’s President Karzai on November 2 to congratulate him when his runoff opponent withdrew and to exhort Karzai to “eradicate corruption.” Karzai obligingly announced to the world that he would “remove the dark stain of corruption” from his government. What jokers these guys are!

It enhances the humor to recall how Obama’s career was built on questionable tactics used by ACORN and other far left supporters. ACORN is a highly biased political outfit alleged to have engaged in election fraud by falsifying or fabricating voter registrations in multiple states. Their reward was being budgeted to receive billions of taxpayer dollars and being made a “partner” with the Census Bureau for the 2010 census. That is genuinely “funny money.” Haha.

Seriously, we must “remove the dark stain of corruption” from our own government before it permanently impairs the quality of our Constitution. But our judges are not able to see the forest for the trees. They dance prissily all around the issue without addressing the very real and urgent question at hand: do we have a legitimate government or not? This question is of the gravest import and deserves to be given a fair trial of truth ASAP in the court of any judge whose sense of justice can transcend the usual myopic fascination with precedent, standing, and jurisdiction.

The judges like to say that Obama’s ineligibility is a political question and therefore out of their jurisdiction. Nonsense, it is a question of what the Constitution says and whether what the Constitution says matters a tinker’s damn. To interpret the Constitution is the federal judiciary’s main purpose.

Judges also evade their responsibility by saying that because all citizens are injured more or less equally by a fraudulent election, no individual citizen—even military personnel—have “standing” in court. These black-robed parrots say that because we are all injured by Obama’s fraud, no one in particular can sue. In sum, what we have now is a former republic with justice for none.

True justice is larger than finely honed distinctions about the letter of the law. There are NO precedents for our present crisis, but Article II must be enforced without delay. In this case of all cases, justice delayed is justice denied.",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Editorial: Nov. 6, 2009 — With Justice for None!","John Gault, T.F.

Cronkite News is a digital media outlet that offers professional experiences to advanced students at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. When you visit the Cronkite News website, you will notice the lack of corporate advertising on the site. The United States is currently the only country where its citizens cannot sue pharmaceutical companies for damages due to vaccines. These companies have been granted legal immunity, and one has to sue the federal government in a special ""Vaccine Court"" to try and get a piece of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, which is funded by taxpayer's taxes paid on the purchase of vaccines. Therefore, much of the information regarding Gardasil injury claims and lawsuits today come from countries outside the U.S., and information about Gardasil injuries inside the U.S. comes mainly from the alternative media which is not sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. In this article from Cronkite News, we read of one family's frustration in trying to receive a settlement for their daughter's injuries due to the Gardasil vaccine, from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Their experience is common in the United States, as the Government Accounting Office (GAO) reported at the end of 2014.",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Vaccine,,,"['pertussis', 'vaccine', 'whooping cough', 'headline', 'medicine watch', 'lyme disease', 'gardasil', 'hpv vaccine', 'flu', 'flu shot', 'marysue grivna', 'tampa', '2015', 'medical kidnap', 'top ten', 'alternative health', 'ddt', 'polio', 'population control', 'john berchielli', 'merck', 'sb277', 'measles', 'washington', 'vaccine court']",,"Medicine Watch, Alternative Health, Headline",,

At this time of year, peppermint hot chocolate, tasty bread and other baked goods, and other delectable items are available all over the place. Just walk into a Dunkin’ Donuts or another fast food restaurant, and you’ll be greeted with dozens of options to satisfy your holiday foodie itch.

But few companies have a monopoly on Christmas as strongly as Coca-Cola. Not only does the brand try to equate their soda with Santa Claus, but they’ve also been leaning into an environmentally conscious polar bear theme. Although these corporate polar bears have a much better gig than real polar bears that are constantly losing their habitat to climate change as the polar ice caps melt, Coca-Cola has pushed their version of these bears onto their customers to great appeal.

The Coca-Cola packaging now has polar bears illustrated on it during the holiday season to help celebrate Christmas.

But these corporate polar bears are hiding a secret in plain sight. While they first debuted on Coca-Cola packaging in 2016, they’re back for the holiday season in 2017. And they’ve got a big secret that some fans are starting to notice.

Take a close look at the images here. If you have a can of Coke at home, pick it up and put it under a magnifying glass. Can you see what the executives at Coca-Cola have infused into the image of the polar bears?

Reddit user sunkist268 noticed it and shared the observation online. The polar bears’ eyes are created out of Coca-Cola bottle caps. And their snouts’ sheen is shaped like Coca-Cola bottles. This is subliminal advertising at its finest.

When you see the secret image, you’ll be hitting yourself wondering how you never spotted it before. But Coca-Cola has master the art of subliminal advertising and has infused it into their campaigns for almost two decades.

Perhaps you remember when American Idol first debuted. Remember how the judges were sitting in chairs that looked just like Coca-Cola bottles? And they also sipped Coca-Cola during the show.

People remarked on the subliminal imagery on the polar bears. The following were some thoughts:

“Omg, I literally had to zoom in but when I did I experienced the magic of Christmas,” one replied.

Polar bears have been a part of Coca-Cola’s ad campaigns since 1993. These versions are new though.

“This year, we wanted to keep the same look and personality while creating a more graphic illustration style that would be easy to print around the world,” Frederic Kahn, Coca-Cola’s design director, told TODAY Food. “We also wanted to embed signature Coca-Cola elements so the Coca-Cola polar bears could immediately be recognizable as our asset.”

Coca-Cola knows how to influence the masses. And Kahn admits it was all planned out.

“When the bears are seen from the side, several have Coca-Cola dynamic ribbons as mouths, and we have some bears holding and drinking Coca-Cola from the contour bottle,” Kahn added.

Bahrainis Continue Sit-in Protest in Front of Senior Cleric Residence in Diraz

http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13951009000861

Hundreds of local residents continued their sit-in outside the house of the Bahraini senior cleric Sheikh Issa Qassim in the village of Diraz, completing their 192nd Day of their presence in the village’s streets to protest policies of Al Khalifa regime against the opposition .

The sit-in started when the Bahraini authorities stormed Sheikh Qassim’s residence to hold him under arrest over the content of sermons he delivered called the regime to make social reforms and practice equity amongst the people, Al Manar reported.

Earlier, dozens of people rallied in Bahrain ahead of nationwide ceremonies in commemoration of political dissidents and pro-democracy campaigners killed at the hands of regime forces.

Demonstrators took to the streets in Sitra Island, chanting slogans against Al Khalifah regime and in condemnation of Saudi support for the Al Khalifa regime.

A similar rally was staged under the banner “Our Martyrs Are Immortal” in the Western village of Shahrakan, where participants held up pictures of slain 17-year-old teenager Ali Abdulghani, whose family says died of injuries suffered during a police chase earlier this year.

Yemeni Forces Shoot down Saudi Apache Helicopter in Najran

http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13951009000957

Yemeni forces shot down a Saudi Apache helicopter in the kingdom’s Southern Najran Province in fresh counterattacks in response to Riyadh’s deadly military aggression. The chopper was brought down on Thursday as it was attacking positions held by the Yemeni fighters, Al Masirah reported. The report further noted that the Yemeni forces destroyed an Abrams tank and killed five Saudi soldiers at Najran’s Qiyadah military base. Three other Saudi soldiers lost their lives in Talah military base in Najran. Two more Saudi tanks were destroyed in Najran’s Rajla military base and southwestern Jizan Region. Moreover, Yemeni snipers killed Saudi soldiers in neighboring Asir Region.

Meanwhile, the Ansarullah forces and the Yemeni army took control of several positions held by Saudi mercenaries in the Sabrin neighborhood of Yemen’s Northern Jawf Province. They also thwarted an attack by Saudi mercenaries in Shabwah Province, leaving a number of the militants dead and injured. Saudi Arabia has been incessantly pounding Yemen since March 2015 with the purpose of reinstalling the country’s former government and crushing the Ansarullah movement. Since then, the popular forces and the Yemeni army have been defending Yemen against the Saudi offensive.

Thursday Humor? Oman To Join Saudi “Anti-Terror Alliance” | Zero Hedge

……………….To be sure, a diplomatic rapprochement would help boost cooperation between Oman, one of the region’s smallest oil producers, and the bloc’s richest members. The GCC is a six-member group that also includes Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

But where things get bizarre is that in the Gulf every day appears to be opposite day: the Saudi-led military alliance is a reference to an anti-terror coalition formed last year at the initiative of Prince Mohammed, King Salman’s son, to face security threats against Muslim nations. Apparently, it does this by either bombing thousands of innocent civilians in neighboring countries like Yemen, or simply creating and funding the Islamic State. Recall that in what may have been one of the most significant email discoveries from the entire Podesta batch, in a leaked email sent on August 17, 2014 by Hillary Clinton to her current campaign manager, John Podesta, who back then was counselor to Barack Obama, she admitted that Qatar and Saudi Arabia “are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.”

But aside from providing financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups, Saudi Arabia is fully on board with the whole “alliance against terrorism” thing.

We next await for Oman to join the Qatari “anti-terror organization”, especially since in the next few years Qatar will be rather stumped at finding out new and more deadly ways of sending its natgas pipeline to Europe via Syria, a venture which after 5 years of desperate attempts to remove Assad and install a puppet regime, has failed following today’s official ceasefire announcement involving Russia, Turkey and Syria.

9928,6309487.0,thesleuthjournal.com,unknown,http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/real-unemployment-rate-20-american-families-everyone-unemployed/,"According to shocking new numbers that were just released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20 percent of American families do not have a single person that is working. So when someone tries to tell you that the unemployment rate in the United States is about 7 percent, you should just laugh. One-fifth of the families in the entire country do not have a single member with a job. That is absolutely astonishing. How can a family survive if nobody is making any money? Well, the answer to that question is actually quite easy. There is a reason why government dependence has reached epidemic levels in the United States. Without enough jobs, tens of millions of additional Americans have been forced to reach out to the government for help. At this point, if you can believe it, the number of Americans getting money or benefits from the federal government each month exceeds the number of full-time workers in the private sector by more than 60 million.

When I was growing up, it seemed like anyone that was willing to work hard could find a good paying job. But now that has all changed. At this point, 20 percent of all the families in the entire country do not have a single member that has a job. That includes fathers, mothers and children. The following is how CNSNews.com broke down the numbers…

A family, as defined by the BLS, is a group of two or more people who live together and who are related by birth, adoption or marriage. In 2013, there were 80,445,000 families in the United States and in 16,127,000—or 20 percent–no one had a job.

To be honest, these really are Great Depression-type numbers. But over the years “unemployment” has been redefined so many times that it doesn’t mean the same thing that it once did. The government tells us that the official unemployment rate is about 7 percent, but that number is almost meaningless at this point.

A number that I find much more useful is the employment-population ratio. According to the employment-population ratio, the percentage of working age Americans that actually have a job has been below 59 percent for more than four years in a row…

That means that more than 41 percent of all working age Americans do not have a job.

When people can’t take care of themselves, it becomes necessary for the government to take care of them. And what we have seen in recent years is government dependence soar to unprecedented levels. In fact, welfare spending and entitlement payments now make up 69 percent of the entire federal budget. For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled “18 Stats That Prove That Government Dependence Has Reached Epidemic Levels“.

And what is even more frightening is that more families are falling out of the middle class every single day. As a recent CNN article explained, approximately one-third of all U.S. households are living “hand-to-mouth”. In other words, they are constantly living on the edge of financial disaster…

About one-third of American households live “hand-to-mouth,” meaning that they spend all their paychecks. But what surprised the study authors is that 66% of these families are middle class, with a median income of $$41,000. While they don’t have liquid assets, such as savings accounts or mutual fund holdings, they do have homes and retirement accounts, with a median net worth of $$41,000. “We don’t expect them to be living paycheck to paycheck,” said Greg Kaplan, study co-author and assistant professor of economics at Princeton University.

The American Dream is rapidly becoming an American nightmare.

When I was growing up, I lived in a pretty typical middle class neighborhood. Everyone had a nice home, a couple of cars and could go on vacation during the summer. I don’t remember ever hearing of anyone using food stamps or going to a food bank. In fact, I can’t even remember anyone having a parent that was unemployed. If someone did leave a job, it was usually quite easy to find another one.

But today, the middle class is being ripped to shreds and according to one new report there are 49 million Americans that are dealing with food insecurity in 2014.

How can anyone not see what is happening to us? America is in the midst of a long-term economic decline, but the mainstream media and most of our politicians seem to think that things are better than ever. They continue to try to convince us that “business as usual” is the right path to take.

But one-fifth of the families in the entire nation are already totally unemployed.

At what point will we finally admit that what we are doing right now is simply not working?

30 percent of all families unemployed?

40 percent?

50 percent?

If we stay on the road that we are on now, things are going to continue to get worse. Millions more jobs will be shipped overseas, millions more jobs will be replaced by technology and crippling government regulations will kill millions more jobs. The middle class will continue to shrink and government dependence will continue to rise.

Most people just want to work hard, put food on the table, pay their mortgages and provide a nice life for their families.

But the percentage of Americans that are successfully able to do that just keeps getting smaller.

Wake up America.

Your middle class is dying.

The South Korean company said in a statement that it will boost dividends by 30 percent from 2015 to about 4 trillion won ($3.4 billion) for the full year of 2016. It will also repurchase its shares in January, which will be then canceled. The total budget for the shareholder returns including dividend payment and share buyback will be about half of its free cash flow for this year.
Samsung also promised to strengthen corporate governance procedures in its board. It will invite one new independent member to the company's nine-person board and create a new governance committee comprised of independent board members. The company currently has six committees on management, audit and others.
For at least six months, Samsung's external advisers will review options of restructuring its corporate structure, including creating a holding company structure.
The announcement comes after Elliott Management Corp. asked Samsung last month to improve Samsung's corporate governance and to simplify its complicated ownership structure. The U.S. activist hedge fund, which tried unsuccessfully to stop a controversial merger of two Samsung companies last year, urged Samsung to review splitting it up into a holding company and an operating company, to list in the U.S. stock market and to add three independent board members.
Samsung is trying to court shareholders and improve its corporate structure as it battles technical and legal challenges. The cause of the fires in its Galaxy Note 7 cellphones remains a mystery while South Korean prosecutors are scrutinizing the alleged connections between South Korean President Park Geun-hye's shadowy confidante and Samsung.
Several Samsung offices have been raided by investigators and its executives including Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have been questioned by prosecutors who are looking at why South Korean businesses donated funds to non-profit foundations under control by Choi Soon-sil, the president's confidante.
The South Korean parliament has stepped up pressure on the country's National Pension Service to say if had any external pressure to approve the contentious merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries last year despite recommendations from proxy advisers to reject it.
Samsung would not say if Lee will attend the parliamentary hearing on the political scandal next week.
On the Galaxy Note 7 problems, Samsung said at the end of October that the company was doing everything to find out what went wrong with the cellphone, which overheated and caught fire, prompting two global recalls and eventual discontinuation of the flagship model. The company since has not updated the public on its investigation results.
Some market watchers say the controversial merger and the smartphone fiasco are the reasons that Samsung should reform its governance structure. Elliott and other minority shareholders in Samsung C&T opposed the merger because it unfairly benefited Samsung founding family members while hurting other small shareholders.
Some investors also blamed the smartphone fiasco on the company's governance structure as well. Samsung's founding Lee family, with a minority stake, and the family's close aides have an outsize influence over the company's major decisions.

The terror cells like the ones that struck Brussels and Paris are under orders to carry out attacks as they see fit at the “right time, place and method” for maximum carnage, officials told The Associated Press. The European and Iraqi intelligence officials and a French lawmaker familiar with Takfiri networks made the warning on Wednesday, a day after terrorist attacks in the Belgian capital Brussels left at least 34 people dead and over 250 others wounded. Back in mid-November, at least 129 people were killed and 352 others injured in another such attack on at least six different venues in and around Paris.

Some camps in Syria, Iraq were described in the report as possible places where the network is designed and the attackers are trained “specifically for attacks against the West.”

French Senator Nathalie Goulet, the co-head of a commission tracking Takfiri networks, believes that given the reach of the terror cells, arresting the assailants or suspects involved in the attacks “doesn't change a thing.” ""The reality is that if we knew exactly how many there were, it wouldn't be happening.""

A European security official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that fighters in the said units are trained in battleground strategies, explosives, surveillance techniques, and counter surveillance. He noted, ""The difference is that in 2014, some of these IS fighters were only being given a couple weeks of training… Now the strategy has changed. Special units have been set up. The training is longer. And the objective appears to no longer be killing as many people as possible but rather to have as many terror operations as possible, so the enemy is forced to spend more money or more in manpower. It's more about the rhythm of terror operations now.""

He talked about a possible dystopian society, with much division, confusion, mistrust of authority, a growing gap between the haves and have nots under an increasingly authoritarian leadership; describing all these misfortunes happening one day in his country, America.

The confusion in the United States today is unspeakable. The political and economic systems are uncertain in the country, and if these two systems are unstable, they affect the social fiber of any society.

In the United States, today many people are confused as to whom to choose to become their leader. In fact, this was evident during and after the 2016 elections in the country when Donald Trump pulled a surprising victory.

Trump lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. Although this made him president, supporters of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, say he’s ‘not their president’. They claim the country’s political system selected Mr Trump, therefore can’t be president over them, sharply dividing the American society. When Trump was declared winner, a series of protests swept across the nation.

A few days after Trump took office in Washington D.C., protests were held against him. Probably, we are yet to witness more of these protests in the days ahead as Trump continues his rule. This clearly shows the deep division in America today, with the current political climate looking shaky.

For the economic system of the United States, you don’t need a professor of economics to tell you that wealth in the country is increasingly concentrated in only a few hands. The gap between the haves and the have nots is widening with each passing day, causing more social unrest.

To prove to you that the gap between the rich and poor is widening, we look at figures provided by the global anti-poverty organization, Oxfam. According to Oxfam, in 2015, the richest 1% owned 48% of all global wealth. In 2016, 62 individuals owned as much wealth as half of the world’s population. But in 2017, the wealth gap is wider than ever: 8 multi-billionaires on the planet — which includes 6 Americans — own more than the combined wealth of half the world’s population.

Many people in the United States are falling deep into poverty. Even the working class in the country are struggling and unable to save money. They live from hand to mouth. Wages are falling while living expenses are rising. Unemployment is rising. Many jobs are leaving the United States, going to China and other cheap labor nations. President Trump has promised to bring back the jobs, but many doubt that he can fulfill the promise.

However, of all these chaotic situations, the writing was already on the wall when a prominent citizen of the country predicted them before he died. Carl Sagan was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist and an author. Sagan was born on November 9, 1934 and died on December 20, 1996. A strong proponent of science, as well as a science communicator in astronomy, he published more than 600 scientific papers and articles. Sagan was author, co-author and editor of more than 20 books and also wrote many popular science books.

In one of his books, titled “The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,” published in 1995, Sagan made the gloomy prediction about his country’s future. The book touches on a variety of topics, from debunking hoaxes like alien abductions to spirituality, ultimately making a passionate argument for science and the scientific method.

A quote from the book has recently gone viral; describing the future America, as though Sagan was a soothsayer. Sagan was known for his optimism, but on one particular paragraph in the book, he was a pessimist. He talked about a possible dystopian society, with much division, confusion, mistrust of authority, a growing gap between the haves and have nots under an increasingly authoritarian leadership; describing all these misfortunes happening one day in his country, America.

Suspecting Carl Sagan had either a time machine or a crystal ball. Ok, probably the time machine. pic.twitter.com/zpKH1HUYhz — Charles Bergquist (@cbquist) January 23, 2017

He wrote:

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”

It looks indeed like Sagan foresaw the future of his country. Remember, a professor of Cliodynamics recently predicted imminent collapse of the American society as well. Professor Peter Turchin of the University of Connecticut said a series of instabilities would rock the United States, claiming it would come as a result of political turmoil, which would shake the American society to its foundational core.

Professor Turchin believed negative trends seem to be accelerating, and that in three years, the path to instability will seem unavoidable for the United States. According to Turchin, at the center of his prediction is “elite overproduction.” He defined elite overproduction as the rich growing richer while relating less and less to the poor. He explained that elite overproduction would result in ideological polarization and fragmentation of the political classes, and eventually lead to chaos.

(Before It's News)

For a few, delegating comes easily, maybe too easy. For others who are perfectionists, letting go of even the most trivial task is almost impossible. If you are in this second category, you probably don’t like the references behind your back that you are a “control freak” or a “micro-manager.”

Business school professor John Hunt notes that only 30 percent of managers think they can delegate well, and of those, only one in three is considered a good delegator by his or her subordinates. This means only about one manager in ten really knows how to empower others.

The challenge is delegating the right things, and not delegating the wrong things. If you don’t get it right, you are too busy, but working on the wrong things. Almost every entrepreneur needs to improve their skills in this area, so I did some research in the basic principles. Jan Yager, in her book “Work Less, Do More,” has outlined several key steps to effective delegation:

Choose what tasks you are willing to delegate. You should be using your time on the most critical tasks for the business, and the tasks that only you can do. Delegate what you can’t do, and what doesn’t interest you. For example, non-computer types should consider delegating their social media, website, and SEO activities.

Pick the best person to delegate to. Listen and observe. Learn the traits, values, and characteristics of those who will perform well when you delegate to them. That means give the work to people who deliver, not the people who are the least busy. This requires hiring people with the right skills, not the least expensive or friends and family.

Trust those to whom you delegate. It always starts with trust. Along with trust, you also have to give the people to whom you delegate the chance to do a job their way. Of course the work must be done well, but your way or the highway is not the right way.

Give clear assignments and instructions. The key is striking the right balance between explaining so much detail that the listener is insulted, and not explaining enough for someone to grasp what is expected. Think back to when you were learning, when you were a neophyte.

Set a definite task completion date and a follow-up system. Establish a specific deadline at the beginning, with milestones. In this way you can check up on progress before the final deadline, without fuzzy questions like “How are you doing?”

Give public and written credit. This is the simplest step, but one of the hardest for many people to learn. It will inspire loyalty, provide real satisfaction for work done, and become the basis for mentoring and performance reviews.

Delegate responsibility and authority, not just the task. Managers who fail to delegate responsibility in addition to specific tasks eventually find themselves reporting to their subordinates and doing some of the work, rather than vice versa.

Avoid reverse delegation. Some team members try to give a task back to the manager, if they don’t feel comfortable, or are attempting to dodge responsibility. Don’t accept it except in extreme cases. In the long run, every team member needs to learn or leave.

Almost everyone who has grown their startup from a one-person entity to a going concern with many employees has struggled with letting go of any task. On the other hand, executives who come from a large company to a startup tend to delegate too much, resulting in high costs and lack of control.

Finally, every entrepreneur needs to set aside their fear of delegating. If you do it right, as outlined above, every task will likely be done better than you could do it. The only thing you can’t delegate is “the buck stops here” role. That can only be done by the person in charge, and it better always be you.

5902,9414993.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/13kahn.html,"Mr. Kahn’s partner in starting Staples was Thomas G. Stemberg, who had previously been his biggest competitor in the New England grocery business. Mr. Stemberg, a leader in introducing nonbranded generic merchandise, started his own chain of discount groceries to compete with Mr. Kahn.

An indication of the rivalry’s intensity came when Mr. Kahn ran ads guaranteeing his customers the best price on Thanksgiving turkeys, the magazine Inc. reported in 1989.

Mr. Stemberg parried with his own ads promising that his company would match the lowest advertised price on turkeys. Technically, that made Mr. Kahn’s claim untrue, a point Mr. Stemberg made to the Massachusetts attorney general’s office. Mr. Kahn withdrew his ads.

Mr. Stemberg found himself out of a job in 1985, after he complained to his bosses about the sale of First National Supermarkets’ warehouse division, which he headed. It had been sold to the Supermarket General Corporation, of which Mr. Kahn was chairman. Mr. Kahn had taken that job after selling his own food company, Purity Supreme, to Supermarket General for $80 million in 1984.

Part of the reason Mr. Kahn had been attracted to First National was that acquiring it meant getting Mr. Stemberg on his team. So the two men, both Harvard alumni, went to a Harvard basketball game and traded ideas for starting a new venture in specialty retailing.

After several Fridays visiting shopping malls — coupled with rigorous analyses — they decided that Mr. Stemberg’s proposal to concentrate on office supplies was the right one.

Mr. Kahn invested the first $500,000 in Staples. In May 1986, the first Staples store opened in Brighton, Mass. A dozen yellow writing pads that would have cost $11.55 from a traditional office-supply dealer went for $3.99.

Leo Kahn was born in Medford, Mass., on Dec. 31, 1916, to parents who had immigrated from Lithuania. He graduated from Harvard and Columbia Journalism School, worked as a reporter at a small Massachusetts newspaper, and served as a navigator for the Army Air Forces in World War II. He joined his father’s wholesale grocery company and started a new retail division, which became Purity Supreme.

He first built small stores, then supermarkets. The company came to include the Heartland Food Warehouse, which Inc. called “the first successful deep-discount warehouse supermarket in the country.”

After his success with Staples, Mr. Kahn, whose fortune came from discounting prices, took on a new challenge: the upscale market. His inspiration was the Bread & Circus health food stores in the Boston area, which he visited repeatedly. He recognized a new kind of affluent consumer, one concerned about physical fitness, food contamination and the environment.

Instead of buying Bread & Circus, he opened his own Fresh Fields store in Washington in 1991. Money magazine named it the nation’s “store of the year” in 1993. In 1996, Whole Foods bought what had become the 22-store Fresh Fields chain. Three years later, it bought another group of Mr. Kahn’s stores, Nature’s Heartland, in the Boston area.

Mr. Kahn’s wife of 11 years, the former Dorothy Davidson, died in 1975. He is survived by his second wife, the former Emily Gantt; his sons Joseph, the deputy foreign editor of The New York Times, and Daniel; his daughter, Elizabeth Mallon; his stepdaughters, Lisa and Xandria Birk; eight grandchildren; and three step grandchildren.

When he was in the grocery business, Mr. Kahn aided a black-owned company that was opening supermarkets in areas of Boston that lacked them by using his influence to get good deals on wholesale food. His philanthropy included endowing two professorships at Harvard and encouraging education about the Holocaust.

In 1987, Forbes magazine asked Mr. Kahn if there were any high-margin areas still to be addressed by “category killers” like Staples. He mentioned back support and other orthopedic supplies; panty hose and lingerie; and telephone installation.",2018-02-11 00:45:12.845877,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"Leo Kahn, Trailblazer in Big-Box Retailing, Dies at 94",Douglas Martin,,"['Kahn  Leo', 'Supermarkets', 'Staples Inc', 'Deaths (Obituaries)', 'Shopping and Retail']","Mr. Kahn found success with supermarkets, and then helped create Staples, the office supply retailer.",,,nytimes
207,244.0,awarenessact.com,conspiracy,http://awarenessact.com/how-spirituality-could-be-the-key-to-coping-with-mental-illness/,"With a number of people now identifying as spiritual rather than religious, researchers have begun investigating to better understand how spirituality plays a role in the modern life. And while we all may understand that spirituality somehow just makes us better, science is beginning to prove it.

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 1 in 5 adults in the U.S.-43.8 million or 18.5% experiences mental illness in a given year. Due to these astoundingly high numbers, experts have begun to seek answers to this crisis in all walks of life.

And with spirituality playing such a major role in many people’s lives, researchers began to wonder whether or not spirituality could aid in the treatment of mental illness.

In order to put this into perspective, it is important to understand what exactly spirituality is. While there is no one definition, there are a number of ways to better understand what spirituality truly means. For starters, spirituality is an individual experience that any person can take part in. It helps to bring meaning and purpose to the lives of those experiencing it. Furthermore, spirituality can bring hope and healing to those who are suffering. And it can encourage us to seek out a loving relationship with ourselves.

Spirituality is also different from religion. While religious traditions include spirituality, spirituality is separate from religion. In fact, in order to be spiritual, religion isn’t even necessary.

What’s more, is that scientists are beginning to understand that spirituality could be paramount in helping the mentally ill to combat their illness. According to the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, there are many links between spirituality and recovery from their illness. In one study, it was discovered that spirituality helped children from smoking, drinking and drug abuse, by combatting the impact of life stresses.

In another study, researchers monitored three groups of people, one with psychotic illness, another group of formal caregivers, and the third group of informal caregivers. While those that were ill held their existential needs as most important, the groups of caregivers considered their material needs to be most important. With that being said, another study found that the majority of parents with a child sick with mental illness felt that spirituality was important in the treatment of their children and wanted spirituality to be included in their treatment.

So how exactly does spirituality help those who are suffering? While researchers aren’t entirely sure, they believe it has to do with the connectedness to something bigger than yourself which can make coping with mental illness much easier. In a way, it helps them to make sense of what they are experiencing.

With spirituality holding such an important role for the mentally ill, where can we begin to incorporate it into our treatments?

While you don’t have to run to your nearest spiritual guru to benefit from spirituality, there are a number of ways you may benefit from it.

NY Times: Hawaii Panics After Alert About Incoming Missile Is Sent in Error

By ADAM NAGOURNEY, DAVID E. SANGER and JOHANNA BARR

REBUTTAL BY

The people of Marxist-Globalist Hawaii were terrorized this past weekend when an early-morning emergency alert “mistakenly” warned of an incoming missile attack. The cellphone and TV alerts, sent by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HEMA), set off widespread panic in a state that was already on edge because of the imaginary threat of North Korea. According to the “official story” put out by HEMA, as quoted in this article: “Someone clicked the wrong thing on the computer.”

Oops. Hey, we all make mistakes — no biggie (rolling eyes).

https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HawaiiAlert.jpg http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/01/15/Pictures/hawaii-mistaken-missile-alert_57202c3c-f9a1-11e7-b07f-b94dbb2f1d8d.jpg http://grassroots.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Oops-Didnt-Get-It-Inspected.jpg

A simple “oops” caused 38 minutes of terror? Seriously?



The “oops” story simply does not add up. Alert systems such as this are multi-step procedures — not a simple “push button” thing. And if the alert was truly the result of “pushing the wrong button,” then why was it not immediately rescinded? Why did it remain in place for 38 long and terror-filled minutes after it was issued? Could it be that the alert was real? Could it be that an actual submarine attack — intended to put the blame on North Korea and trigger the war that Trump is actually trying to avoid — was thwarted by “the White Hats” on Saturday? Sound crazy to you? Well, it’s a heckuva lot more plausible-sounding that the idea of an “oops” alert — a colossal screw-up unprecedented in American history.

Now, who would dare to attempt such a horrible false-flag? Who, other than the world’s main superpowers, even possesses such submarine missile-launch capacity? This is only a hypothesis, but certainly a much more reasonable one than “oops.” In fact, we have been warning about such a scenario for a few years now. Flashback time: From The Anti-New York Time issue of April, 2017 (here)

***************************



“As it is in Syria, so too it is in the Korean peninsula. We are just one Israeli false-flag attack from being stampeded into another “Remember the Maine” moment. Such a stunt would actually be easier to pull-off under Korean waters than on Syria’s land. You see, Israel’s state-of-the-art submarines, sold to them at a deep-discount by the pathetic Germans, have the capacity to prowl all of the world’s waters and even launch missiles. Who would dare to accuse “our ally” of taking out an American vessel in Korean waters? Or of hitting Hawaii? No, sir. That would be “anti-Semitic,” don’t you know?



We are not predicting this nightmare submarine scenario. Suffice it to say that the arrival of American warships in Korea and China’s front yard will be an event fraught with danger on many levels.”



http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/map-430594.jpg http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53a08f35ecad048325de7f9b-3500-2330/rtr3u1xl.jpg http://www.a-w-i-p.com/media/blogs/articles/Articles3/ZIO_dolphin-sub_450_flipped_89.jpg

The public has already been conditioned to fear North Korean submarine and missile attacks. Who would ever suspect Israel?



***************************

*End of flashback



One year before that article, in 2016, in a TomatoBubble piece titled, “Japan and Israel Plot Against China and North Korea” (here) we warned:



http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-358552-thumbflex-tudg-358552.jpg http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/01/F160112KBG04.jpg http://www.vosizneias.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/h_52063895.jpg

Once the game pieces have been set, a single false-flag torpedo blast from one of Israel’s state-of-the-art German-made, nuclear-armed submarines could serve as the match which ignites the Pacific and draws Judaized-America into something horrific.

***************************



*End of flashback

We will not declare “nailed it” this time because A: This stuff is far too deadly serious to even give the appearance of gloating about, and B: We cannot declare Israeli treachery with 100% certainty. It’s quite possible that the Globalist faction of the CIA has its own submarines and missiles. Another possibility is that a false alarm — with no submarines involved. — was triggered at HEMA in the hopes of inducing a U.S. first strike (leading to a North Korean retaliation). All that we will say is that we ain’t buyin’ this “oops” explanation. No way. And what makes this strange event all the more suspicious is that it came just weeks after numerous Fake News warnings of a “missile threat” to Hawaii. Here are just a few examples:

Newsweek (December 17, 2017): Hawaii Taking Major Steps To Prepare For Potential Strike From Kim (here)

Washington Post (Decemeber 1, 2017): Hawaii Tests Nuclear Alarms as North Korea Threat Escalates (here)

Los Angeles Times (November 10, 2017) As North Korean Threat Grows, Hawaii Prepares for Nuclear Attack (here)



That’s known as “predictive programming,”

They claim to be “patriots”.

They say that they are “Constitutionalists”.

And they say that they are opposed to the thoroughly evil and corrupt “globalists” and the “deep state” operatives of the United States political system, the intelligence community, the military-industrial complex, the pedophile and human trafficking networks, and their witting and unwitting accomplices in the mainstream and the ‘alternative’ media.

While, however, completely ignoring the “globalists” and “deep state” operatives of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious establishments in the United States that provide the theological foundations and ‘justification’ for this evil and corruption. (But obviously, according to Chapter 13, verse 12 of the Revelation of John, “this second beast is servant to the first beast”; in other words , the religious system is servant to the political system).

Because, to them, theology (and Revelation and Prophecy) is completely irrelevant .

Although, nakedly or indirectly, they claim that ‘God is on their side’.

Although, nakedly or indirectly, they fantasize that their war against the “globalists” and the “deep state” is fully equivalent to the War of the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness.

Nonsense.

And, worse, they fantasize that they will be victorious .

(While, apparently unbeknownst to these “patriots” , the “globalists” and “deep state” operatives are determined to start World War III with North Korea/Iran/ Syria/Ukraine, et al.)

But, unfortunately, they are no less dismissive and contemptuous of the Revelations and Prophecies I have sent them than are the aforementioned “globalists” and “deep state” operatives; that is, they completely ignore the Prophecies in the Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light:

http://unsealing-the-seven-seals.blogspot.com/2018/01/epitaph-on-zionist-israels-death-by.html

In other words, while the “globalists” and “deep state” operatives correspond to the Sadducees at the time of Jesus; these patriots only correspond to the Pharisees .

And, remember, the Pharisees were no less opposed to and contemptuous of the Teaching of Jesus that the Doctrine of “the resurrection” is a Doctrine of ‘Rebirth’ than were the Sadducees.

Meanwhile, according to the Message to the Church in Philadelphia in Chapter 3, verse 12 of the Revelation of John : “…I will write on him my new name.” (For more information see:

https://unsealing-the-seven-seals.blogspot.com/2015/08/censorship-by-religion.html and the included links; and, furthermore, an eagle is mentioned in the Prophecy of August, 1979:

Jung used the term “synchronicity”.

In other words, a victory of the New England Patriots over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Superbowl of February 4 would NOT be a GOOD sign.

Mr. O'Neill is considered by many to be America's greatest dramatist and is the only American playwright to win the Nobel Prize in literature, which he received for the body of his work in 1936, years before he wrote what are thought to be his masterworks, ''The Iceman Cometh'' and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' ''The Iceman Cometh'' had its Broadway debut in 1946 and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' was first performed in 1956, three years after Mr. O'Neill's death.

Mr. O'Neill's father, the actor James O'Neill, named the cottage for ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' a play whose title role he played thousands of times over three decades. Late in life, the elder O'Neill lamented that he had ''fallen for the lure of easy popularity and easy money,'' according to a biography of Eugene O'Neill by Louis Sheaffer.

While a financial success, James O'Neill was a frugal man, especially in the construction of his family's New London home on land he purchased in 1884, four years before Eugene's birth.

Sally Pavetti, the cottage's curator, said in a magazine article: ''Rather than build a new home from scratch, he chose instead to 'assemble' a residence. Located on the property when he bought it were a store, a dwelling and a schoolhouse. Mr. O'Neill moved them together'' and added a few Victorian touches like a porch, a tower room and a widow's walk.

The section of the cottage that was a one-room school became the living-room setting for Mr. O'Neill's autobiographical ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' The same room, with slight changes, also appears in his only comedy, ''Ah, Wilderness,'' according to Lois McDonald, assistant curator of the cottage. Ms. McDonald and Ms. Pavetti have overseen restoration of the cottage since it was purchased by the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center of nearby Waterford in the 1970's.

The playwright spent many summers at Monte Cristo Cottage, the only home he knew while growing up. The remainder of the year, James O'Neill was on the road and the family lived in hotels until Eugene and his brother Jamie were old enough to go to boarding schools.

After James O'Neill's death in 1920, Eugene O'Neill never visited Monte Cristo cottage again, Ms. McDonald said. Ownership of the cottage was assumed by a New London bank and real estate agent and it was sold in 1937.

A new addition to the cottage is based on a pencil sketch of its original lean-to kitchen that was drawn by Eugene O'Neill. It will provide handicapped access, room for a book and gift shop and office space, and cost $200,000, said Preston Whiteway, general manager of the O'Neill Center. The cottage, at 325 Pequot Avenue, will be open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday and by appointment Sunday. Admission is $5.

''The Iceman Cometh'' had its Broadway debut in 1946 and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' was first performed in 1956, three years after Mr. O'Neill's death.

Nobody doubts that Jeff Bezos is a liberal who opposes Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and any semblance of a conservative agenda. We normally associate the Washington Post as his venue for spreading his progressive propaganda, but it turns out Alexa, the digital assistant produced and distributed by Amazon, is another way he pushes his agenda.

In a sometimes-crude video by Steven Crowder, the conservative comedian asks Alexa several questions. Topics ranged from Antifa and Black Lives Matter to Muhammad and Jesus Christ. The answers were often editorialized with left-leaning answers. Some were downright insulting.

It was a stark reversal of the policy set eight years earlier, when the Clinton administration told agencies to make records available whenever they could, even if the law provided a reason not to, so long as there was no ''foreseeable harm'' from the release.

Generally speaking, said Alan Brinkley, a Columbia University historian, while secrecy has been increasingly attractive to recent administrations, ''this administration has taken it to a new level.''

Its ''instinct is to release nothing,'' Professor Brinkley said, adding that this was not necessarily because there were particular embarrassing secrets to hide, but ''they are just worried about what's in there that they don't know about.''

The Bush administration contends that it is not trying to make government less open. Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, said, ''The bottom line remains the president is dedicated to an open government, a responsive government, while he fully exercises the authority of the executive branch.''

Secrecy is almost impossible to quantify, but there are some revealing measures. In the year that ended on Sept. 30, 2001, most of which came during the Bush presidency, 260,978 documents were classified, up 18 percent from the previous year. And since Sept. 11, three new agencies were given the power to stamp documents as ''Secret'' -- the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services.

In Congress, where objections to secrecy usually come from the party opposed to the president, the complaints are bipartisan. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat first elected in 1974, said, ''Since I've been here, I have never known an administration that is more difficult to get information from.'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said things were getting worse, and ''it seems like in the last month or two I've been running into more and more stonewalls.''

Mr. Cheney says the Bush policies have sought to restore the proper powers of the executive branch. Explaining the fight to control the task force records to ABC News last January, he said that over more than three decades: ''I have repeatedly seen an erosion of the powers and the ability of the president of the United States to do his job. We saw it in the War Powers Act, we saw it in the Anti-Impoundment Act. We've seen it in cases like this before, where it's demanded that the presidents cough up and compromise on important principles. One of the things that I feel an obligation on, and I know the president does, too, because we talked about it, is to pass on our offices in better shape than we found them to our successors.''

Mr. Bush has made similar comments. But the more relevant history may have been in Texas, where Mr. Bush, as governor, was also reluctant to make government records public. Confronted with a deadline to curb air pollution, he convened a private task force to propose solutions and resisted efforts to make its deliberations public. When he left office, he sent his papers not to the Texas State Library in Austin, but to his father's presidential library at College Station. That library was unable to cope with demands for access, and the papers have since been sent to the state library.

Framing an Argument

One argument underlies many of the administration's steps: that presidents need confidential and frank advice and that they cannot get it if the advice becomes public, cited by Mr. Cheney in reference to the task force and by Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, in explaining the administration's decision to delay the release of President Ronald Reagan's papers.

Mr. Gonzales said ''the pursuit of history'' should not ''deprive a president of candid advice while making crucial decisions.''

Some administration arguments are more closely focused on security. Mr. Ashcroft has said that releasing the names of people held for immigration offenses could give Al Qaeda ''a road map'' showing which agents had been arrested.

Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has threatened action against Pentagon officials who discuss military operations with reporters, said before troops at the Army's Special Operation Command on Nov. 21, 2001, ''I don't think the American people do want to know anything that's going to cause the death of any one of these enormously talented and dedicated and courageous people that are here today.''

The critics argue more generally. Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, argues that secrecy does more harm than good. The Central Intelligence Agency's exaggerated estimates of Soviet economic strength, for example, would have stopped influencing United States policy, Mr. Moynihan said, if they had been published and any correspondent in Moscow could have laughed at them.

''Secrecy is a formula for inefficient decision-making,'' Mr. Moynihan said, and plays to the instincts of self-importance of the bureaucracy.

Mary Graham, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, saw two major risks in this administration's level of secrecy.

''What are often being couched as temporary emergency orders are in fact what we are going to live with for 20 years, just as we lived with the cold war restrictions for years after it was over,'' Ms. Graham said. ''We make policy by crisis, and we particularly make secrecy policy by crisis.''

Moreover, she said, it ignores the value of openness, which ''creates public pressure for improvement.'' When risk analyses of chemical plants were available on the Internet, she said, people could pressure companies to do better, or move away.

Mr. Fleischer contends that there is no secrecy problem. ''I make the case that we are more accessible and open than many previous administrations -- given how many times [Secretary of State Colin L.] Powell, Rumsfeld and Ashcroft have briefed,'' he said.

Asked if there was anyone in the administration who was a consistent advocate of openness, who argued that secrecy hurt as well as helped, Mr. Fleischer said President Bush was that person. He said that was exemplified by the fact that while ''the president reserved the authority to try people under military tribunals, nobody has been tried under military tribunals.''

In the cases of Zacarias Moussaoui and John Walker Lindh, he said, Mr. Bush has opted for the more open and traditional route of the criminal justice system.

Shielding Presidents

The Bush administration's first major policy move to enforce greater secrecy could affect how its own history is written.

On March 23, 2001, Mr. Gonzales, the White House counsel, ordered the National Archives not to release to the public 68,000 pages of records from Ronald Reagan's presidency that scholars had requested and archivists had determined posed no threat to national security or personal privacy. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the documents were to become available after Jan. 20, 2001, twelve years after Mr. Reagan left office. Mr. Reagan's administration was the first covered by the 1978 law.

The directive, which also covered the papers of Mr. Reagan's vice president and the president's father, George Bush, was to last 90 days. When Mr. Gonzales extended the sealing period for an additional 90 days, historians like Hugh Davis Graham of Vanderbilt University attacked the delays, saying they were designed to prevent embarrassment and would nullify the records law's presumption of public access to those documents.

On Nov. 1, 2001, President Bush issued an even more sweeping order under which former presidents and vice presidents like his father, or representatives designated by them or by their surviving families, could bar release of documents by claiming one of a variety of privileges: ''military, diplomatic, or national security secrets, presidential communications, legal advice, legal work or the deliberative processes of the president and the president's advisers,'' according to the order.

Before the order, the Archivist of the United States could reject a former president's claim of privilege. Now he cannot.

The order was promptly attacked in court and on Capitol Hill. Scott L. Nelson of the Public Interest Litigation Group sued on behalf of historians and reporters, maintaining that the new order allowed unlimited delays in releasing documents and created new privileges to bar release.

House Republicans were among the order's sharpest critics. Representative Steve Horn of California called a hearing within a few days, and Representative Doug Ose, another Californian, said the order ''undercuts the public's right to be fully informed about how its government operated in the past.'' The order, Mr. Horn said, improperly ''gives the former and incumbent presidents veto power over the release of the records.''

On Dec. 20, the White House sought to silence the complaints by announcing that nearly all the 68,000 pages of the Reagan records were being released. Legislation introduced to undo the order never made it to the House floor, where leaders had no interest in embarrassing the president. And a lawsuit challenging the order languishes in Federal District Court before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.

Historians remain angry. Robert Dallek, a biographer of Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, said, ''This order of Bush, we feel it's a disgrace -- what it means is if this policy applies, they can hold presidential documents close to the vest in perpetuity, the way Lincoln's papers were held by the family until 1947.''

Battling the Congress

The administration's most publicized fight over secrecy, and its biggest victory to date, has come over its efforts to keep the investigative arm of Congress from gaining access to records of the energy task force led by Vice President Cheney.

This fight is only the showiest of many battles between the Bush administration and members of Congress over information. Such skirmishes happen in every administration. But not only are they especially frequent now, but also many of the loudest Congressional complaints come from the president's own party, from Republicans like Senator Grassley and Representative Dan Burton of Indiana.

The vice president framed the fight as being less about what the papers sought by the General Accounting Office might show than over power -- what Congress could demand and how it could get it or what essential prerogatives the executive branch could maintain, especially its ability to get confidential advice. And he welcomed the battle. In an interview the day before the suit was filed, he said. ''It ought to be resolved in a court, unless you're willing to compromise on a basic fundamental principle, which we're not.'' And on Dec. 9, Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court ruled for the vice president.

Judge Bates ruled that David M. Walker, who as comptroller general heads the General Accounting Office, had not suffered any personal injury, nor had he been injured as an agent of Congress, and therefore the suit could not be considered. An appeal is all but certain to be filed, but for the time being, the administration clearly has a victory.

''Vice President Cheney's cover-up will apparently continue for the foreseeable future,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who pressed Mr. Walker to act, hoping to find evidence of special interest favoritism for Republican donors in the Cheney documents.

There have been other bitter fights over disclosure between the White House and the Congress. While the Democrats controlled the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the chairman, James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, repeatedly threatened last year to subpoena the Environmental Protection Agency for documents explaining the scientific basis and potential impact of its proposed air pollution rule changes requiring aging power plants to install new pollution controls when their facilities are modernized. Mr. Jeffords, who never got around to issuing the subpoena, argued that the administration had broken its promises of cooperation.

Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was infuriated last August when the Justice Department said it would send answers to some of his questions about how it was using the USA Patriot Act to the more pliant Intelligence Committee, which was not interested. Mr. Sensenbrenner threatened to issue a subpoena or ''blow a fuse.''

Mr. Grassley, the incoming chairman of the Finance Committee, said administration obstruction required him to go and personally question government officials working on Medicare fraud cases, instead of sending his staff. But his new chairmanship and the Treasury confirmations before it may give him a lever. He said he told a White House aide of his problems and asked, ''How can I get a presidential nominee through if I have to be spending my time doing things my investigators could be doing?''

Closing the Courtroom

Legal policy is where the administration's desire to maintain secrecy has excited the most controversy. Since the first few days after the Sept. 11 attacks, the federal government has insisted on a rare degree of secrecy about the individuals it has arrested and detained.

The immigration hearings held for hundreds of people caught in sweeps after the bombings have been closed to relatives, the news media and the public.

The names of those detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service have been kept secret, along with details of their arrests, although on Dec. 12 the Justice Department told The Associated Press there had been 765 of them, of whom only 6 were still in custody.

A few dozen individuals have been held as material witnesses, after the Justice Department persuaded federal judges that they had information about terrorism and might flee if released. Neither their names nor the total number of them have been made public.

The administration has also kept a tight lid on the identities of the military detainees being held at Guantánamo, Cuba. But in considering how to deal with them, in military tribunals, the government has moved away from secrecy. When Mr. Bush directed the Defense Department in November 2001 to set up military tribunals to try noncitizens suspected of terrorism, one reason cited was the ability to hold those proceedings in secret, to protect intelligence and to reduce risks to judges and jurors. But when the rules were announced in March, they said ''the accused shall be afforded a trial open to the public (except proceedings closed by the presiding officer).''

While the government's policy in the immigration cases has suffered some judicial setbacks, appeals and stays have allowed it to remain in effect.

Fundamentally, the government has argued against opening hearings by contending that they would make available to terrorists a mosaic of facts that a sophisticated enemy could use to build a road map of the investigation, to know what the government knew or did not know, and thus to escape or execute new attacks.

That argument was also made in the main case involving releasing the names of those detained, where the government also maintains that the Freedom of Information Act's right to privacy would be violated by a release of the names.

Legal scholars have objected particularly to the decision to close all the immigration hearings, rather than parts of them. Stephen A. Schulhofer, a professor at New York University Law School, said there was already a legal provision for closing a hearing when a judge was shown the necessity.

The ''road map'' explanation seemed implausible, Mr. Schulhofer said, because the detainees had a right to make phone calls, in which ''a real terrorist could alert cohorts who would not have known he was detained.''

At a recent seminar at Georgetown University Law School, Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff said protecting privacy was the main reason for suppressing the names. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, dismissed that rationale, asking Mr. Chertoff, ''How can you even say that with a straight face?''

So far, the government has won challenges to the detention of material witnesses.

On releasing the names, it lost in a Federal District Court here, but appeared to have impressed two of the three appeals court judges who heard the case in November.

On the question of a blanket closing of ''special interest'' immigration hearings, an appeals court in Cincinnati ruled against the government in August and one in Philadelphia ruled in its favor in October. The Supreme Court is likely to be faced with choosing between them.

Putting Sand in the Gears

Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, governments at all levels feared that information they made publicly available could be useful to terrorists, and began moves to curtail access, a trend the Bush administration encouraged.

The first of the strictures on information resulting from Sept. 11 were described by Ms. Graham, the Brookings and Kennedy School scholar, in her book, ''Democracy by Disclosure'' (Brookings Institution Press, 2002).

''Officials quickly dismantled user-friendly disclosure systems on government Web sites,'' she wrote. ''They censored information designed to tell community residents about risks from nearby chemical factories; maps that identified the location of pipelines carrying oil, gas and hazardous substances; and reports about risks associated with nuclear power plants.''

Many of those withdrawals mirrored efforts industry had been making for quite a few years, arguing that the public did not really need the information. Some information has been removed from public gaze entirely. James Neal, the Columbia University librarian, said that officials of libraries like his around the country that serve as depositories for federal information ''have some concern about the requests to withdraw materials from those collections.'' Perhaps even more important, Mr. Neal said, was that ''we also do not know what materials are not getting distributed.''

Some material that has been removed from Web sites is still available, though obviously to fewer people, in government reading rooms. The chemical factory risk management plans cited by Ms. Graham are no longer available through the Internet, said Stephanie Bell, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency. But individuals can look at up to 10 of them and take notes (but not photocopies) in 55 government reading rooms around the country, Ms. Bell said. There is at least one reading room in every state except Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.

Last March the Defense Department issued a draft regulation concerning possible limits on publication of unclassified research it finances and sharp restrictions on access by foreign citizens to such data and research facilities.

This prompted some concerted resistance from scientists. Bruce Alberts, a biochemist who heads the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences, told the academy's annual meeting on April 29:

''I am worried about a movement to restrict publication that has been proceeding quietly but quickly in Washington. Some of the plans being proposed could severely hamper the U.S. research enterprise and decrease national security. It is being suggested that every manuscript resulting from work supported by federal funds be cleared by a federal project officer before being published, with serious penalties for violations. Another rule could prevent any foreign national from working on a broad range of projects.''

Even though the department withdrew its proposal and officials say there has been no decision on whether to try again, the scientists say they are still worried.

The new Ashcroft directive on Freedom of Information requests has also begun to be felt. A veteran Justice Department official said he believed that fewer discretionary disclosures were being made throughout the government because ''as a matter of policy, we are not advocating the making of discretionary disclosures.''

Delays are one clear reality. The General Accounting Office reported last fall that ''while the number of requests received appears to be leveling off, backlogs of pending requests governmentwide are growing, indicating that agencies are falling behind in processing requests.''

To Thomas Blanton, who helps run the National Security Archive, which collects and posts documents gained through Freedom of Information Act, that is a clear effect of the Ashcroft order.

''What these signals from on high do in a bureaucracy, they don't really change the standards,'' Mr. Blanton said, ''but they put molasses or sand in the gears.''

This is KVoimakas, group organizer for RKBA. I have changed the following in this diary: added RKBA to the title, changed the tags a small amount, added the boilerplate, and added this small explanation of what was changed. Everything else is D's.

I have always found it ironic that organizations like the NRA have consistently been supported by white right wingers, yet historically some of the same people have worked long and hard to stop black people from bearing arms.

I remember the media frenzy that took place, in the late 60’s when members of The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense showed up in Sacramento with weapons

and had similar demonstrations in Seattle(shown above), and other parts of the nation. As a result, on June 28, 1967 The California State legislature passed the Mulford Act, prohibiting the carrying of firearms in any public place, which was signed into law by then Governor Ronald Reagan and which effectively outlawed Black Panther safety patrols in Oakland.

We all know the history of Dr. Martin Luther King, the Civil Rights Movement and non-violence. However the black liberation struggle in the United States has never been monolithic, and there has always been a difference of opinion in the community around issues about guns, gun control and the 2nd amendment, including where many of us stand on self-defense. Though the BPP was the focus of attention and symbolized one perspective on this issue, much less has been written about a group that pre-dated the Panthers by two years.

That was The Deacons for Defense and Justice.

Not much was written about them, and though many of us in the movement knew about the Deacons it wasn't until 2004, when the University of North Carolina Press published The Deacons for Defense Armed Resistance and the Civil Rights Movement, by Lance Hill, that a comprehensive history was available for the greater reading public.

In 1964 a small group of African American men in Jonesboro, Louisiana, defied the nonviolence policy of the mainstream civil rights movement and formed an armed self-defense organization--the Deacons for Defense and Justice--to protect movement workers from vigilante and police violence. With their largest and most famous chapter at the center of a bloody campaign in the Ku Klux Klan stronghold of Bogalusa, Louisiana, the Deacons became a popular symbol of the growing frustration with Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent strategy and a rallying point for a militant working-class movement in the South. Lance Hill offers the first detailed history of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, who grew to several hundred members and twenty-one chapters in the Deep South and led some of the most successful local campaigns in the civil rights movement. In his analysis of this important yet long-overlooked organization, Hill challenges what he calls ""the myth of nonviolence""--the idea that a united civil rights movement achieved its goals through nonviolent direct action led by middle-class and religious leaders. In contrast, Hill constructs a compelling historical narrative of a working-class armed self-defense movement that defied the entrenched nonviolent leadership and played a crucial role in compelling the federal government to neutralize the Klan and uphold civil rights and liberties.





A year before the publication of the book, the Deacons were the subject of a 2003 made for television movie, Deacons for Defense.

The film, produced by Showtime stars academy-award winner Forest Whitaker, Ossie Davis and Jonathan Silverman. The film is based on the actual Deacons for Defense and their struggle to fight against the Jim Crow South in a powerful area of Louisiana that is controlled by the Ku Klux Klan. The film bases the story around a white-owned factory that controls the economy of the local society and the effects of racism and intimidation on the lives of the African-American community. The film follows the psychological transition of a family and community members from ones that believe in a strict non-violent stance to ones that believe in self-defense.





Some of us learned about the Deacons during the time that Rap Brown, also from Louisiana, was working with Howard University students. Their stance did not surprise us, since many of us had the example of members of our own families who had always had guns, both for hunting and for protection.

The Deacons had a relationship with other civil rights groups that advocated and practiced non-violence: the willingness of the Deacons to provide low-key armed guards facilitated the ability of groups such as the NAACP and CORE to stay, at least formally, within their own parameters of non-violence.[8] Although many local chapters felt it was necessary to maintain a level of security by either practicing self-defense as some CORE, SNCC, and NAACP local chapters did, the national level of all these organizations still maintained the idea of non-violence to achieve civil rights. Nonetheless,in some cases,their willingness to respond to violence with violence, led to tension between the Deacons and the nonviolent civil rights workers whom they sought to protect. Organizations like SNCC, CORE, and SCLC all had major roles in exposing the brutal tactics that were being used against Black people in America, particularly to Southern Blacks. This was seen as crucial to getting legislation passed that would protect African-Americans from this oppression and help develop their status of equality in America. However, according to Lance Hill, author of, The Deacons for Defense: Armed Resistance and the Civil Rights Movement, ""the hard truth is that these organizations produced few victories in their local projects in the Deep South—if success is measured by the ability to force changes in local government policy and create self-governing and sustainable local organizations that could survive when the national organizations departed...The Deacons’ campaigns frequently resulted in substantial and unprecedented victories at the local level, producing real power and self-sustaining organizations.""[9] According to Hill, this is the true resistance that enforced civil rights in areas of the Deep South. Many times it was local (armed) communities that laid the foundation of equal opportunities for African-Americans. National organizations played their role of exposing the problems but it was local organizations and individuals who implemented these rights and were not fearful of reactionary Whites who wanted to keep segregation alive. Without these local organizations pushing for their rights, and many times, using self-defense tactics not much would have changed according to scholars like Hill. An example of this type of force needed that made substantial change in the Deep South took place in early 1965. Black students picketing the local high school were confronted by hostile police and fire trucks with hoses. A car of four Deacons emerged and in view of the police calmly loaded their shotguns. The police ordered the fire truck to withdraw. This was the first time in the twentieth century, as Lance Hill observes, ""an armed black organization had successfully used weapons go defend a lawful protest against an attack by law enforcement.""[2] Another example as Hill writes is, ""In Jonesboro, the Deacons made history when they compelled Louisiana governor John McKeithen to intervene in the city’s civil rights crisis and require a compromise with city leaders—the first capitulation to the civil rights movement by a Deep South governor.""[10]

There are many black folks who are watching the governments response to groups like The Huttaree terrorists. Hutaree militia arrests point to tripling of militias since 2008

The Hutaree is one of 127 armed militias in the US, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit organization in Montgomery, Ala., that tracks hate groups nationwide. That number has increased 200 percent since 2008, when there were 42, SPLC says. There is ""no question"" the catalyst was President Obama’s election, says Heidi Beirich, the center’s director of research. A similar upswing took place after President Clinton’s election in 1993. Militias and the antigovernment groups that spawn them often become more active when the federal government turns more liberal. ""A major shift to the left certainly helped"" in both cases, Ms. Beirich says. The economic meltdown and the growth of minorities such as Latinos are also a factor, she adds.





The Southern Poverty Law Center has a listing of Active 'Patriot' Groups in the United States in 2009. My county is on the list.

I support non-violence as a strategy. I support self-defense as a stance.



I live in a county in New York full of hunters. Many of them are members of local white militia groups. Quite a few support the Tea Party.

Does this worry me – yes.

They state:

The Intelligence Project identified 512 ""Patriot"" groups that were active in 2009. Of these groups, 127 were militias, marked with an asterisk, and the remainder includes ""common-law"" courts, publishers, ministries and citizens' groups. Generally, Patriot groups define themselves as opposed to the ""New World Order,"" engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing, or advocate or adhere to extreme antigovernment doctrines. Listing here does not imply that the groups themselves advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities, or are racist. The list was compiled from field reports, Patriot publications, the Internet, law enforcement sources and news reports. Groups are identified by the city, county or region where they are located.





I heard some of the teapartier’s in my area talking about that same ""New World Order"". Not particularly reassuring.

News stories like this one: Oklahoma conservatives, lawmakers plot anti-federal militia, increase my unease.

I will continue to counter protest peacefully in my community and speak out and organize against Republicans and racists who are hell bent on taking us back to 1860. But I sleep with one eye open, troubled by the rising tide of hate.

And I think often of the 1960's and the Deacons.

President Obama ’s favorite word is “unprecedented,” as Carol Lee of Politico pointed out. Yet he often seems mired in the past as well, letting his hallmark legislation get loaded up with old-school bribes and pork; surrounding himself with Clintonites; continuing the Bushies’ penchant for secrecy and expansive executive privilege; doubling down in Afghanistan while acting as though he’s getting out; and failing to capitalize on snazzy new technology while agencies thumb through printouts and continue their old turf battles.

Even before a Nigerian with Al Qaeda links tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines jet headed to Detroit , travelers could see we had made no progress toward a technologically wondrous Philip K. Dick universe.

We seemed to still be behind the curve and reactive, patting down grannies and 5-year-olds, confiscating snow globes and lip glosses.

Instead of modernity, we have airports where security is so retro that taking away pillows and blankies and bathroom breaks counts as a great leap forward.

If we can’t catch a Nigerian with a powerful explosive powder in his oddly feminine-looking underpants and a syringe full of acid, a man whose own father had alerted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria , a traveler whose ticket was paid for in cash and who didn’t check bags, whose visa renewal had been denied by the British, who had studied Arabic in Al Qaeda sanctuary Yemen , whose name was on a counterterrorism watch list, who can we catch?

In a rare bipartisan success, House members tried to prevent the Transportation Security Administration from implementing full-body imaging as a screening tool at airports.

Just because Republicans helped lead the ban on better technology and opposed airport security spending doesn’t mean they’ll stop Cheneying the Democrats for subverting national security.

Congressman Pete Hoekstra of Michigan was weaselly enough to whack the president and “weak-kneed liberals” in his gubernatorial fund-raising letter.

Before he left for vacation, Obama tried to shed his Spock mien and juice up the empathy quotient on jobs. But in his usual inspiring/listless cycle, he once more appeared chilly in his response to the chilling episode on Flight 253, issuing bulletins through his press secretary and hitting the links. At least you have to seem concerned.

On Tuesday, Obama stepped up to the microphone to admit what Janet Napolitano (who learned nothing from an earlier Janet named Reno) had first tried to deny: that there had been “a systemic failure” and a “catastrophic breach of security.”

But in a mystifying moment that was not technically or emotionally reassuring, there was no live video and it looked as though the Obama operation was flying by the seat of its pants.

Given that every utterance of the president is usually televised, it was a throwback to radio days — just at the moment we sought reassurance that our security has finally caught up to “Total Recall.”

All that TV viewers heard, broadcast from a Marine base in Kaneohe Bay, was the president’s disembodied voice, talking about “deficiencies.”

Citing the attempt of the Nigerian’s father to warn U.S. authorities six months ago, the president intoned: “It now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect’s name on a no-fly list.”

In his detached way, Spock was letting us know that our besieged starship was not speeding into a safer new future, and that we still have to be scared.

Federal investigators identified many unreported events by having independent doctors review patients’ records.

The inspector general estimated that more than 130,000 Medicare beneficiaries experienced one or more adverse events in hospitals in a single month.

Many hospital administrators acknowledged that their employees were underreporting injuries and infections that occurred in the hospital, he said.

When the National Academy of Sciences issued a landmark report on patient safety in 1999, many experts said that hospital employees were often afraid to admit mistakes. But that no longer appears to be the main obstacle to reporting, federal investigators said.

More often, Mr. Levinson said, the problem is that hospital employees do not recognize “what constitutes patient harm” or do not realize that particular events harmed patients and should be reported.

In some cases, he said, employees assumed someone else would report the episode, or they thought it was so common that it did not need to be reported, or “suspected that the events were isolated incidents unlikely to recur.”

To clear up confusion, Medicare officials said they would develop a list of “reportable events” that hospitals and their employees could use. In addition, the Medicare agency said, hospitals should give employees “detailed, unambiguous instructions on the types of events that should be reported.”

The Obama administration and hospital industry leaders have placed a high priority on reducing medical errors. But, the report said, at many hospitals, this high-level commitment has not been translated into practice.

The inspector general found that “hospitals made few changes to policies or practices” after employees reported harm to patients. In many cases, hospital executives told federal investigators that the events did not reveal any “systemic quality problems.”

Organizations that inspect and accredit hospitals generally “do not scrutinize” how hospitals keep track of medical errors and other adverse events, the study said.

The federal investigators did an in-depth review of 293 cases in which patients had been harmed. Forty of those cases were reported to hospital managers, and 28 were investigated by the hospitals, but only five led to changes in policies or practices, the study said.

More than 2,900 hospitals have joined the administration in a “partnership for patients” intended to reduce errors and save 60,000 lives in three years.

At least 27 states have laws that require hospitals to report publicly on infections that patients develop in the hospital, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, up from 6 at the end of 2005.

5967,9675305.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/dining/wines-for-thanksgiving-that-refresh-the-palate.html,"But if your Thanksgiving is anything like mine, you’ve got a lot more than four at the table. They start eating and drinking early and keep at it until late, with dinner a free-for-all buffet. Most likely, you won’t be using the finest goblets. Plastic is not out of the question. So here are the two crucial points to consider when selecting Thanksgiving wines:

VERSATILITY This is not the time to fuss over specific food and wine pairings. You need all-purpose wines that will go with many different sorts of dishes. One should be red, the other white, with additional sparkling or rosé wines at your discretion. You will want plenty. Few things are as sad as running out of wine on Thanksgiving, except running out of food. Figure a bottle per adult.

ENERGY Wines should be nimble and refreshing, energizing rather than fatiguing and low in alcohol, if possible. It’s a long, tiring meal, and the last thing you want are heavy, alcoholic, torpor-inducing wines. Instead, they should be light and exhilarating, the sort that promote salivation rather than comas.

The challenge is determining which wines fit this bill. Enter the wine panel. All the wines we brought would have been fine for a Thanksgiving meal, even the cider. It’s important to understand, though, that these are representative of the sorts of wines to seek out. Most likely, these specific bottles will be hard to find, but not to worry. Many similar wines will be available.

Let’s first take the cider, which Pete brought. He wanted one of his bottles to be American, and what’s more American than cider? The leading beverage of colonial America, it’s undergoing a renaissance today. The Hidden Star Semi-Dry cider, from Slyboro in upstate New York, was deliciously refreshing and a mere 6.9 percent alcohol. You could drink it throughout the meal, but if you are used to the complexity and savor of wine, you may grow tired of the fairly simple flavors.

The top white wines were excellent, and coincidentally none were more than 12 percent alcohol. Julia, who likes to fly the flag for sauvignon blanc, brought a 2012 example from the Loire. It carried the appellation Vin de Pays de Loire, meaning it was from outside the more exalted districts worthy of an appellation, like Sancerre, which accounted for its $14 price. Nonetheless, it was exactly the sort of wine we were looking for: fresh, savory and lithe. Many Loire sauvignon blancs fit this category.

We had two rieslings, both from the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Florence brought the 2013 Almost Dry riesling from the undersung Montinore Estate. It was an interesting choice, as many people fear the hint of sweetness that “Almost Dry” implies. But this wine was bright and refreshing, with light floral notes. Bernie brought the other riesling, a 2013 Crow Valley Vineyard from Teutonic Wine Company, a producer I ordinarily love. But this bottle lacked the fine balance of the Montinore. Other similar choices include dry rieslings from the Finger Lakes of New York, or modestly sweet kabinetts from Germany.

Photo

My wine was a 2011 Etna Bianco from Benanti, a Sicilian white that I love for its savory, almost saline flavors. The others weren’t sold on it at first, but it came alive with food. Good alternatives include other whites from Mount Etna made with the carricante grape, and many dry southern Italian whites like fianos and falanghinas from Campania.

The reds were even more successful. Our top bottle was the 2012 Willamette Valley Gamay Noir from Division Wine Company, brought by Bernie. It was the perfect sort of energetic, pure wine to seek for Thanksgiving. I wasn’t surprised that it was a gamay as it’s the grape of Beaujolais, always a go-to choice. I’ve recently been tasting more and more delicious American gamays. I’d snap them up, but there isn’t much to go around, so I’d happily settle for good Beaujolais.

Photo

Our No. 2 red was an outlier. Julia found this rarest of treasures on closeout for $23, a good, affordable Burgundy with a bit of age, the complex and understated 2008 Charles Audoin Marsannay. You won’t find many cheap Burgundies like this, but it’s a reminder that, if you have money to spend, a modest, slightly older Burgundy is a great choice. So are the more restrained examples of pinot noir.

My own wine was the 2013 Jambalaia Rouge from La Clarine Farm in the Sierra Foothills, a spicy, unfiltered wine made from a hodgepodge of grapes. It’s simple, goes down easy and I liked it well enough, but the others liked it more. Julia called it “autumnal,” and Pete described it as “juicy cheerfulness but a bit adolescent,” which said it well.

Finally came Pete’s red, a 2011 Tikves vranac, a grape little known outside of Macedonia, its home territory, and Florence’s, a 2010 Bordeaux blend from Martha Clara on the North Fork of Long Island. Pete said he was seeking something exotic, although the ripe, somewhat tannic flavors of red and black fruits seemed familiar. Florence always likes to choose something from close to home. This was a good wine, but, as with the vranac, straightforward and not as exciting as the other reds.

Almost all avoided the cardinal Thanksgiving sins of being overbearing, strident and bombastic. That goes double for wines as well as relatives.

Oudin was surprisingly upbeat, knowing that she had been undone by a rotten draw and a conquering, late-blooming champion.

“She pretty much doesn’t have a weakness on the clay, I don’t think,” Oudin said.

Strange to think that, at this time last year, Schiavone was simply another player, a tour veteran who had lost in the French Open’s first round in 2009. But one two-week romp, then a roll on the court and a kiss of the clay, changed everything.

“Of course, much more people recognize me,” Schiavone said Sunday. “People like to have a picture, enjoy to ask me what did you feel that day?”

Photo

Yes, the attention has been overwhelming, if not overdue. Schiavone received a hero’s welcome in the small northern Italian town of Passirano, where she often spends weekends with her parents when not in nearby Milan, where she lives.

After playing the springtime event in Rome for years with little acclaim, she was the star attraction this time, where she reached the quarterfinals, before losing to Stosur.

But the question, perhaps lost in her internal translation, was not how the perception of Schiavone has changed. It is how Schiavone has changed.

Her first Grand Slam event was the 2000 United States Open, in which she reached the third round. But for most of the next decade, Schiavone was little more than a notable example of consistency. She typically showed up, won a couple matches and bowed out of tournaments midway through the bracket. Her year-end ranking would be somewhere from No. 17 to No. 41. In her first 35 Grand Slam tournaments, she reached the fourth round eight times and the quarterfinals twice.

But in her last seven Grand Slam events, all after age 29, she has reached the fourth round six times and the quarterfinals four times. In a young woman’s sport, Schiavone has built a career upside down.

“I think I am more cautioned over who I am and what I want,” Schiavone said. “I think a lot of experience can become true in everything that I am doing. Not just tennis. But life.”

But the burst of success has come so late.

“Late for you,” she said. “Not late for me.”

She is a throwback of sorts, playing an all-court game in a time of baseline whackers. And she has none of that corporate evasiveness that permeates many of her image-making peers; even during news conferences, she leans back casually, thinks out loud and generally acts and talks as if she is at an outdoor cafe.

But Schiavone was changed by last year’s victory, when she became the oldest first-time winner of a Grand Slam women’s event in the Open era since 30-year-old Ann Jones of Britain won Wimbledon in 1969.

Photo

“When you win a match like this, a tournament like this, you grow as a person,” Schiavone said. “You are much more sure. You want to win another title. Your goal is bigger.”

She added, “I want to keep going, to find a new emotion.”

Oudin, too, would like to find a new emotion. Her career arc, just being drawn, has taken on a much more common shape.

In 2009, Oudin, an undersize American, announced herself with a fourth-round run at Wimbledon. Just short of her 18th birthday, she followed with a bulldog’s tear to the quarterfinals of the United States Open. Expectations among an impatient American fan base rocketed with her ranking.

But Oudin, still only 19, has so far been just another quick-bursting bottle rocket on the tour. She has not passed the second round of a major tournament since that United States Open ride. She is ranked No. 88. Usually a first- or second-round casualty, Oudin occasionally shows signs of her plucky past, like when she beat the rising German star Julia Görges at Miami in March.

But most days are like Monday, when Oudin drew the opening assignment against Schiavone. Oudin beat Schiavone in an indoor Fed Cup match in San Diego last year, but the circumstances were far different Monday.

“She definitely impressed me,” Oudin said. “I haven’t played anyone that hits that heavy of a ball and then can hit amazing slice and move that well on the clay and play good defense.”

Schiavone said she was riding emotion from last year, honored to open the day’s matches on the main court.

“The court is perfect,” she said. “Everything is going around you and it’s like — you know when you go home and your mom does everything for you and you feel comfortable? Yeah, I felt like this.”

So comfortable, so familiar, that she did not need to drop and thank the clay.

The long-rumored move was made official Monday morning, when the race team announced it on Twitter and via a news release.
Dillon, 24, has made 18 career starts in NASCAR's top series and was a full-time driver in the XFINITY Series the last three seasons, finishing fifth in points this season. In 111 career XFINITY starts, Dillon has one win, 24 top-five and 70 top-10 finishes in addition to four poles. Dillon also has three wins, 35 top-five and 35 top-10 finishes, plus five poles, in 53 career Camping World Truck Series starts.
""I have been preparing for this next step in my career for several years,"" Dillon said. ""With my experience in the Camping World Truck Series and XFINITY Series, I am ready to drive full-time in the (Premier) Series. I want to thank Bob Germain and the entire Germain Racing organiza tion for giving me this opportunity. It will be an honor to represent a brand and sponsor like GEICO which has played such a significant role in the sport for so many years.""
Mears, 38, is a 14-year veteran of NASCAR's top series -- with one win, 13 top fives, 51 top 10s and three poles in 488 career starts. His lone win came in the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway while driving for Hendrick Motorsports in 2007. He had been driving the GEICO-sponsored car for Germain since taking over the ride in the middle of the 2010 season.
Dillon is the grandson of Richard Childress, owner of Richard Childress Racing, and the younger brother of Austin Dillon, who drives the No. 3 Chevy for RCR. Germain Racing began a technical alliance with RCR in 2014 when it switched to Chevrolet as its manufacturer.
""First of all, I want to thank Casey Mears for everything he's done for our race team over the past six years,"" team owner Bob Germain said. ""He's been an integral part of our growth and a great representative for GEICO and our many partners. Bringing Ty onboard is an exciting opportunity for us and we are committed to giving him all the resources he needs to reach his full potential. He's a very talented driver and first-class young man. I'm looking forward to working with him, as well as expanding our relationship with RCR.""

230,268.0,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/vegans-response-to-cop-sharing-photo-of-cooked-breakfast-to-support-local-farmers-goes-viral/,"When a police force in a rural part of the United States shared a picture of their cooked breakfast, which included eggs and sausage, you wouldn’t think anyone would be offended. But vegans who saw the image were furious. They began lashing out at the cops for posting the photo of the hearty breakfast.

But the North Wales Police Rural Crime Team had simply posted the photo to support the local farmers in response to the National Farmers Union (NFU) posted a “farmhouse breakfast” campaign meeting.

The cops spared no expense when cooking their breakfast to support the farmers. It includes plump breakfast sausages, dozens of perfectly poached eggs, ham, baked beans and enough slices of toast for each officer.

The image was posted to Twitter, and most people were happy to see the rural police force supporting the farmers in the area.

But one woman named Diana, who claims to be a vegan, lashed out and wrote:

“Speaking as a taxpayer, I’d prefer them to be less selective when answering questions and perhaps not post breakfast pics that offend vegetarian/vegan followers – pretty thoughtless considering the job title they have.”

Although Diana thought she had a good argument, many other members of the community were quick to retaliate. Farmer Jono Dixon shared the following in response to Diana’s post:

“It’s pathetic. The vegans are ruling the roost. They are nothing more than a menace. We as carnivores or vegetarians don’t dictate about there preferred diet so its time they stopped trolling and whining about everyone’s daily diets.”

Although people were eager to hear what Rural Crime Team leader Rob Taylor had to say in response to Diana’s vegan outburst, he said his lack of response had nothing to do with the vegans who found the breakfast feast “offensive.”

“We regularly get 1m impressions each month, and in August alone we had 1.9m impressions,” Crime Team leader Taylor said. “We just can’t answer (all inquiries) anymore as it’s a huge commitment. Over Christmas, we had too much general interaction with people from various walks of life bombarding our feed with questions, and we couldn’t cope.”

Because the rural cops care about the farmers in their area, they plan to continue to post to their Twitter page. They have about 15,000 followers and an extensive reach on social media. Most of their followers love them and support everything they do.

Although the Rural Crime Team refused to admit that the vegans had won, since Christmas Day, they have not posted any more images showcasing the eggs and bacon they eat to start off their day of crime fighting.

They did share the following post:

“We have considered all options, and from immediate effect, we will cease responding to comments and questions until further notice.”

Readers of Metro generally did not find the sausage “offensive,” but felt that way about the vegan post.

“Previous generation: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.’ Today’s generation: ‘Everything hurts.’”

Do you think it is okay for the police to share an image of their breakfast if it includes meat?",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Vegan’s Response To Cop Sharing Photo Of Cooked Breakfast To Support Local Farmers Goes Viral,Alexander Smith,,[''],,,,

Fighter of Libyan forces allied with the U.N.-backed government aims his weapon as he takes up position inside a ruined house at the front line of fighting with Islamic State militants in Ghiza Bahriya district in Sirte Thomson Reuters 
By Patrick Markey 
SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - After six months of heavy fighting, Libyan forces have advanced so deep into the strategic city of Sirte that they can pick out the Tunisian and Egyptian accents of their Islamic State enemies as they trade insults over the frontline. 
Victory is imminent on this remote front of the war against Islamic State, with the last few militants staging a last stand in a small area of just one square kilometer (0.4 square mile), U.S. and Libyan officials say. 
But the battle has been long and hard, and holds lessons for U.S. backed forces trying to force Islamic State out of the much larger Iraqi city of Mosul more than 2,500 km (1,500 miles) away. 
""We faced unbelievable resistance. They won't leave their posts even when houses are collapsing on them,"" said Osama Issa, a 37-year-old businessman fighting with Libyan forces in Ghiza, the last neighborhood of Sirte that Islamic State holds. 
""They know they will die anyway so they fight well."" 
Defeat in Sirte will damage Islamic State's ability to show it is expanding globally and deprive it of a foothold outside Iraq and Syria. Losing it and Mosul in quick succession would dent its morale and possibly its ability to recruit followers. 
But the militants in Sirte have inflicted heavy losses on the Libyan fighters -- at least 660 have been killed and 3,000 wounded -- and held out longer than expected. 
They have proved their skills in guerrilla warfare, shown the vulnerability of advancing forces that lack expertise in urban warfare and highlighted the limited effectiveness of air strikes when frontlines are so close. 
The battle has also underlined the importance of trapping fighters during battle because many have escaped from Sirte -- a Libyan commander put the number at 400 -- and are now staging attacks behind frontlines with increasingly sophisticated bombs. 
Growing rivalry between the various factions in the Libyan forces also serves as a warning to the diverse groups fighting Islamic State in Mosul: the end of the battle may bring political chaos and the risk of new military conflicts. 
""DIRTY WAR"" 
Islamic State gradually took over Sirte from early 2015, taking advantage of the chaos in Libya since the start of a civil war in which long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011. 
Sirte, Gaddafi's former hometown, became its main base in North Africa. Just as in Iraq and Syria, militant commanders began to impose their strict vision on Sirte, banning shisha pipe smoking and forcing woman to wear all-covering robes. 
Later, they enslaved migrant women, imposed taxes and meted out punishments such as public whippings and crucifixions. 
Forces from the nearby city of Misrata, aligned with the U.N.-backed government in the capital Tripoli, started the military offensive to recapture Sirte in May after Islamic State threatened their security. 
The last jihadists are holding out in the Ghiza neighborhood of the Mediterranean port city, using improvised tunnels, booby traps and snipers. 
Hiding among collapsed rooftops and in rubble-packed streets in Ghiza, they have sand-filled fridges and tunnels which provide protection against shelling and air strikes. 
The Libyan forces have been backed by hundreds of U.S. air strikes and helicopter raids, and small teams of U.S. and British military advisors. They are now using Soviet-era tanks to blast paths through rubble as they go from house to house, trying to end the militants' resistance. 
""We hear them at night shouting to us, telling us they are coming for us,"" said Asruf el Qat, a student fighting in the rubble of Ghiza's many collapsed villas. ""It's snipers, and landmines. We advance, they throw grenades. It's a dirty war."" 
Sniper fire crackled as Qat's brigade kept watch though holes in walls, and occasional shells whistled overhead. 
Another brigade armed with AK-47 assault rifles -- some of them older men in uniform, others students in jeans and flip flop shoes -- prepared to flush out a sniper holed up nearby. 
LOST OUTPOST 
Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called this month for jihadists to travel to Libya. It was not his first call for Libya recruits -- Tunisians, Sudanese and Egyptian fighters fought in the city. But Sirte as a base is finished. 
""Sirte was supposed to be a fallback from Iraq and Syria. That's now gone,"" said Geoff Porter at North Africa Risk Consulting. ""Strategically, the Islamic State could point to Sirte and tell its followers that it really was global and growing. It can't do that anymore."" 
Misrata intelligence officials say there were once 2,500 militants in Sirte, the majority of them foreign jihadists. 
Sirte is now largely deserted. No life has returned to the outer districts of a city of 80,000 residents, where buildings are pockmarked with shell craters and bullet holes. 
Few signs of Islamic State's rule remain. A large Libyan national flag now flies at the Zafaran roundabout, where militants once crucified victims. Islamic State tax symbols are still spray-painted on shop walls. 
The Libyan forces are mostly civilians who fought Gaddafi and returned to help against Islamic State -- students, mechanics and former army officers among them. 
""Maybe it will take a week or two from what I can see now (to end Islamic State's resistance in Sirte),"" said Salah Al Houti, 22, a student fighting with the Libyan forces. ""They stocked supplies and food underground."" 
Libyan commanders say their advance has been slowed by casualties and a lack of ammunition, and complain they received none of the night vision equipment and other weaponry they asked for their allies to deal with snipers. 
Fears about trapped civilians, at times used as hostages, have increased caution about air strikes and shelling. 
""It has been the same situation as in Iraq and Syria. They (Islamic State) are using tunnels and using civilians as human shields,"" Misrata intelligence chief Brigadier Mohamed Gnaidy said. 
""They are professional fighters. Their objective is to kill as many of us as possible."" 
NEW BATTLES AHEAD? 
Libyan commanders hope victory in Sirte will remove the threat of Islamic State across the whole country. 
But the fighters who escaped before Sirte was completely surrounded are still a threat. Some may have fled south, potentially reinforcing links between Islamic State and militant groups in the arid Sahel region, including Nigeria's Boko Haram, and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. 
Others now stage guerrilla attacks near Sirte with devices detonated by remote control. They had previously used long wires to trigger roadside bombs or planted landmines. 
Another growing problem is the rivalry among fighting groups. Some are turning their attention to renewed fighting with other factions to the east, where Khalifa Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally, is leading the Libya National Army force that does not recognize the Tripoli U.N.-backed government. 
Haftar's forces took over four key oil ports from a rival faction this year. He has allowed oil exports to reopen for the National Oil Corporation but many in Misrata see him as a military strongman in the making. 
""I fought in three wars, and the fourth might be against Haftar, and who knows about a fifth,"" said Abdulminam Abu Breda, a car mechanic who fought in battles for the control of Tripoli and is now fighting in Sirte.

He was outclassed as all three judges scored the fight 80-72, giving Mesi every round.

Underscoring his triumphant return was the fear for Mesi's health -- if not, in fact, for his life. There were three ring deaths last year, and another just a few weeks ago, from subdural hematomas, the technical term for the injury Mesi sustained.

""I'm scared, that's all I can say,"" Teddy Atlas, the boxing trainer and television analyst, said Wednesday in Manhattan. ""Something of his brain has been compromised.""

Jack Mesi, Joe's father and manager, said: ""I love my son and I wouldn't do anything to put him in harm's way. And boxing is what Joe wants to do with his life.""

Joe Mesi's dream of becoming heavyweight champion of the world was deferred because of the injuries he sustained during his 10-round decision over Vassily Jirov, the former cruiserweight champion who had moved up to the heavyweight division, on March 13, 2004.

Mesi then went through a court battle to get his license back. When his license was suspended in Nevada, the suspension was followed in all other states. But a Nevada judge ruled four months ago that when the boxing license expired on Dec. 31, 2004, , so did the medical suspension, and the Nevada commission no longer had jurisdiction over him.

Mesi passed the medical examinations given to him by the Puerto Rican boxing commission and returned to the ring.

Dr. Robert Cantu has put himself in Mesi's corner -- literally. ""The blood vessels in Joe's brain that bled have healed,"" said Cantu, one of the many neurologists and neurosurgeons who have examined Mesi over the last two years and pronounced him fit to fight. ""It's been clotted over and not there to break again. He's at no greater risk now of suffering brain damage than any other fighter.""

Cantu, the co-director of the Neurological Sports Injury Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the chief of neurosurgery at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass., was in Mesi's corner Saturday night as a licensed cutman. ""I didn't see anything wrong,"" he said after the fight. ""I'm sure at some point in the near future he'll be tested, but I think it's a good idea that all fighters, regardless of how tough a fight they've had, should be tested.""

7400,1751608.0,conservativetribune.com,bias,https://conservativetribune.com/media-wont-report-cabinet/,"Sure, every time someone in the Trump administration does anything remotely objectionable, the media will jump all over them. Remember CNN’s breathless bulletin that President Trump got two scoops of ice cream and everyone else got one? Apparently, this is what counts as reporting nowadays.

It’s just as important to look at what the press doesn’t report about the Trump administration as it is to analyze what they do. That’s especially true when it comes to a Bible study being attended and Trump’s cabinet members every week and which will soon include Vice President Mike Pence.

In fact, the first major media report on the study came from the Christian Broadcasting Network, which conducted an interview with the man who leads it, Ralph Drollinger.

Drollinger, a former NBA player with the Dallas Mavericks and a two-time NCAA men’s basketball champion, is a clergyman who founded Capitol Ministries. He’s already helped establish Bible studies in 40 state capitals and teaches studies in both chambers of Congress.

Drollinger also helped establish the White House Bible study, which is attended by “about a dozen” of the men and women in Trump’s cabinet.

“It’s the best Bible study that I’ve ever taught in my life. They are so teachable; they’re so noble; they’re so learned,” Drollinger said

“These are godly individuals that God has risen to a position of prominence in our culture,” Drollinger said.

CBN reported that “Health Secretary Tom Price, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo are just a few of the regulars.”

Jeff Sessions, who also attends the Bible study, was singled out for praise by Drollinger.

“He’ll (Jeff Sessions) go out the same day I teach him something and I’ll see him do it on camera and I just think, ‘Wow, these guys are faithful, available and teachable and they’re at Bible study every week they’re in town,'” Drollinger said.

President Trump has been invited to attend, although he hasn’t yet; he receives a copy of Drollinger’s weekly teachings instead.

Vice President Pence is the groups sponsor and will soon be attending, Drollinger says.

“Mike Pence has respect for the office. He dresses right — like it says Joseph cleaned himself up before he went to stand before the Pharaoh,” Drollinger said.

“Mike Pence has uncompromising biblical tenacity and he has a loving tone about him that’s not just a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal,” he added.

“And then fourthly, he brings real value to the head of the nation.”

“I just praise God for them,” Drollinger said. “And I praise God for Mike Pence, who I think with Donald Trump chose great people to lead our nation.”

This is the first Bible study in the White House for over 100 years. Yet, where do you hear about this in the media? The press is silent, and you can probably guess why.

After providing saliva, they were given estimates of their genetic risk for more than 20 different conditions, including obesity, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, several forms of cancer, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. About six months after getting the test results, delivered in a 90-page report, the typical person’s level of psychological anxiety was no higher than it had been before taking the test.

Although they were offered sessions, at no cost, with genetic counselors who could interpret the results and allay their anxieties, only 10 percent of the people bothered to take advantage of the opportunity. They apparently didn’t feel overwhelmed by the information, and it didn’t seem to cause much rash behavior, either.

In fact, the researchers were surprised to see how little effect it had. While about a quarter of the people discussed the results with their personal physicians, they generally did not change their diets or their exercise habits even when they’d been told these steps might lower some of their risks.

“We had theorized there would be an improvement in lifestyle, but we saw no sign whatsoever,” Dr. Topol says. “Instead of turning inward and becoming activists about their health, they turned to medical screening. They had a significant increase in the intent to have a screening test, like a colonoscopy if they were at higher risk for colon cancer.”

The people in the study chose on their own to pay for the tests — about $225, a steep discount from the retail price at the time — so they weren’t necessarily representative of the general population. But in another study, published in Health Economics, researchers surveyed a representative sample of nearly 1,500 people and found most people willing to take a test even if didn’t perfectly predict their risks for disease.

About 70 percent of the respondents were willing to take even an imperfect test for genetic risks of Alzheimer’s, and more than three-quarters were willing to take such tests for arthritis, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Most people also said they’d be willing to spend money out of their own pocket for the test, typically somewhere between $300 and $600.

A minority of the respondents didn’t want the tests even if they were free, and explained that they didn’t want to live with the knowledge. But the rest attached much more value to the tests than have the experts who have been warning of the dangers.

“The medical field has been paternalistic about these tests,” says Peter J. Neumann, the lead author of the study, who is director of the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center. “We’ve been saying that we shouldn’t give people this information because it might be wrong or we might worry them or we can’t do anything about it. But people tell us they want the information enough to pay for it.”

Why do experts differ from consumers on this issue? You could argue that the experts are better informed, but you could also argue that some of them are swayed by their own self-interest. Traditionally, people have had to go through a doctor to get a test, which could mean paying a fee to the physician as well as to a licensed genetic counselor. Buying tests directly from a company like Navigenics or 23andMe can cut out hundreds of dollars in fees to the middlemen.

To experts, the tests may seem unnecessary or wasteful when there’s nothing doctors can do to prevent the disease. But consumers have other reasons to want the results. They may find even bad news preferable to the anxious limbo of uncertainty; they may consider an imprecise test better than nothing at all.

“We should recognize that consumers might reasonably want the information for nonmedical reasons,” Dr. Neumann says. “People value it for its own sake, and because they feel more in control of their lives.”

The traditional structure of American medicine gives control to doctors and to centralized regulators who make treatment decisions for everyone. These genetic tests represent a different philosophy, and point toward a possible future with people taking more charge of their own care and seeking treatments customized to their bodies. “What we have today is population medicine at the 30,000-foot level,” says Dr. Topol. “These tests are the beginning of a new way to individualize medicine. One of the most immediate benefits is being able to use the genetic knowledge to tweak the kind of drugs people take, like choosing among statins and beta blockers to minimize side effects.”

That may be the self-empowered future, but for now residents of New York still can’t be trusted to buy these tests directly. It’s paternalism run amok, says Lee Silver, a professor of molecular biology and of public policy at Princeton, who is developing another variety of genetic test for consumers.

“It seems like a no-brainer,” Dr. Silver says, “that any competent adult should be free to purchase an analysis of their own DNA as long as they have been informed in advance of what could potentially be revealed in the analysis. You should have access to information about your own genome without a permission slip from your doctor.”

The paternalists argue that it’s still unclear how to interpret some of these genetic tests — and it is, of course. But if you ban these tests, or effectively eliminate them for most people by imposing expensive and time-consuming restrictions, how does that help the public? When it comes to knowing their own genetic risks, most people seem to prefer imperfect knowledge to perfect ignorance.",2018-02-11 00:44:54.039017,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"Heavy Doses of DNA Data, With Few Side Effects",John Tierney,,"['Tests and Testing', 'Genetics and Heredity', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Navigenics Inc', '23andMe']","Most people say they’ll pay for genetic tests even if the predictions are sometimes wrong, and most people don’t seem to be traumatized even when they receive bad news.",,,nytimes

The traditional version comes from the Venerable Bede, the eighth-century monk whose “Church History of the English People” tells of the invasion of the island by Germanic tribes (the Angles, Saxons and Jutes), who displaced the people they found there and set the foundations of English language and culture. “But what if there never was an invasion?” Pye asks. He is looking at archaeological evidence that shows a much more gradual takeover, involving centuries of peaceable trade and commingling. Bede’s compact and serviceable creation myth obscures a history in which those tribes, along with others in present-day Scandinavia, Belgium and the Netherlands, pushed European civilization onward, inventing or reinventing concepts, coining new terms and new ways of seeing.

Much of the story Pye reports involves money and the making of it. The people he writes about lived marginal lives; they inhabited the marshy and unpredictable coastal lands that kings and noble families tended to stay clear of. But the tenuousness of their position gave them an advantage, since it meant they weren’t locked into the rigid feudal system. They learned to do things on their own, as individuals. The Frisians, and then other groups along the Dutch and Flemish coasts, heaped soil up into artificial hills and used dams and dikes to reclaim land from the sea and rivers. They began buying and selling this new territory, developing a ­real-estate-based economy. The reclaimed land was good for pasturing, which led to the herding of cows and then to another Dutch innovation, cleanliness, because butter- and cheese-making demanded it.

These coastal peoples did business with one another. If you are in Ipswich, on England’s east coast, Pye notes, and “if you think in terms of the time it takes to get to places, then Bergen in Norway is closer than York in England.” The North Sea became a community of traders. Their activity required a currency to give relative value to various goods, so the participants resurrected the Roman practice of using coin money. The Frisians minted silver coins and, Pye says, “the Anglo-Saxons in England imitated the Frisians.” These northern peoples also, he suggests, may have had a hand in promoting double-­entry bookkeeping. Later, the first stock exchanges came into being in this part of Europe.

Pye devotes a good chunk of his book to the boogeymen of medieval Europe, the Vikings. He follows them on their swaggering voyages, stating that they not only plundered Ireland but also settled in and reshaped Dublin, turning it from “an accident of a holy place” into “a base for trading.” It’s a bottom-up argument: that as the Catholic Church and Europe’s monarchies became bloated and slow, these small-scale innovators found openings to exploit. They enriched themselves, and in time their innovations were adopted by others. The cities that participated in the Hanseatic League — which ranged around the North and Baltic Seas and made free-trading alliances with little regard for national boundaries — are prime evidence for this argument.

Pye’s book starts to get a bit clogged as he pulls other types of change under the explanatory paradigm of his argument, sometimes with sweeping generalizations. Thus he says the traders of the North Sea adopted “the idea of thinking of weather as a phenomenon in itself, not the expression of some higher power,” and asserts that thanks to such changes “magic was becoming self-conscious.”

But this isn’t to complain that Pye goes too far with his argument on behalf of these northern peoples. On the contrary, he has made such a compelling case that I would have welcomed more development of these far-flung connections. To take one provocative example, he observes that in the 1330s, while the pope was selling indulgences, French theologians were “measuring ratios for grace and love and charity.” The clever aspect of this lies in his conclusion. He’s not out to condemn the cheapening of faith but to delineate the spread of traders’ math: “When both virtue and sin can be turned into numbers, and calculated and assessed, mathematics has entered the minds of theologians and philosophers and not just engineers and merchants.” This is a lively notion, but to prove it, or at least make the connection persuasive, would require exploring it for more than two paragraphs.

While it has been the youth movement that has propelled the Yankees back into the thick of the playoff picture, Friday night proved that the veterans who remain have some juice left, too. No one loomed larger than Mark Teixeira. He went 2 for 3 and reached base five times as the Yankees quickly pushed Rays starter Blake Snell out before the end of the third and then capitalized on Tampa Bay’s haggard bullpen. In the midst of it, they overcame a bumpy outing from Michael Pineda, who struck out seven in 4 ⅔ innings but gave up back-to-back home runs in the fourth.

It was Teixeira who cracked open the game in the fourth, just after the end of the first rain delay. With Kevin Jepsen on the mound after a 21-minute delay and Rob Refsnyder already on first, Gary Sanchez singled and Starlin Castro walked, bringing up Teixeira with the Yankees holding a 3-2 lead. After running a 1-1 count, Teixeira walloped a 94-mile-an-hour fastball over the right-field wall for a grand slam. It produced what might be one of his last moments of glory at Yankee Stadium, too, as Teixeira came out for a curtain call.

“I remember my first one, and this may be my last,” Teixeira said of the curtain call. “That’s pretty cool.”

These performances had been too few and too far between for him. He had come into the day hitting just .198 and lost his everyday job to a time-share with Tyler Austin as the Yankees shifted to an evaluation mode for the future. Austin was the hero Thursday, cracking a game-winning, walk-off home run against the Rays.

That night and into Friday, Austin’s phone buzzed with congratulatory text messages.

“He’s probably answered as many text messages in one day as he probably ever has in his life,” Girardi said.

The excitement for Austin and his own joy could be understood. One year ago, Austin found himself at the low point of his career. On Sept. 1, a day when major league rosters expand to 40 players and minor leaguers flood into big league clubhouses, the Yankees found him disposable — let alone worthy of a promotion. To clear room for someone else, they designated Austin for assignment. He received a perfunctory phone call from General Manager Brian Cashman and then lingered in purgatory as any team could claim him off waivers.

He was still just 24 but had just completed a wretched season in which he posted a combined .343 on-base-plus-slugging percentage between the Class AA and AAA levels. In a few months he had gone from intriguing prospect to throwaway.

“I wouldn’t say they gave up on me,” he said. “They just needed a spot.”

This was all rejiggered in Austin’s mind Friday afternoon. The Yankees have become a team rejuvenated by youth and Austin was part of the new lifeblood. While Sanchez has earned the acclaim and Aaron Judge is the more highly hyped prospect, Austin has put himself back into the team’s plans.

Next year, he could vie for the starting first-base job with Greg Bird, who missed this past season with a shoulder injury.

These are the names and faces that are slowly becoming household for the Yankees as they continue on their whimsical late-summer run and the ones that they will build around for the years to come. Even if the old stalwarts are finding ways to remain relevant for now.

“The landscape has changed a little bit,” Girardi said. “Some of the players that the people used to come out and see are no longer here. And some of these kids will build a reputation and people are going to get really excited.”",2018-02-11 00:49:06.337595,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"Yankees Ride Out Rain, With Their Future Suddenly Looking Bright",Mike Vorkunov,,"['Baseball', 'New York Yankees', 'Tampa Bay Rays']",Mark Teixeira hit a grand slam home run to help the Yankees move within a game of the final wild-card spot.,,,nytimes

So far, other big names have not been charged, but the scandal and the suggestion that it deserves to grow wider have fed the well of anger.

Drivers are flying flags from the antennas of their cars depicting a black scorpion on a blood-red background, demanding that the police reinvigorate an investigation that many believe would bring to justice some of the city's most powerful people -- including cabinet members in the last Parti Québécois provincial government -- for patronizing female prostitutes as young as 14.

Just two weeks ago, a conservative opposition lawmaker submitted to the provincial assembly a petition with 80,000 names demanding that the investigation -- dubbed Operation Scorpion by the police -- cast a wider net beyond the 44 arrests of suspected pimps and clients since last December.

The protesters have a song (called ''Carry On''), a Web site, posters and T-shirts to promote their cause. One baker has designed a loaf of bread in the shape of the scorpion. Mobs jeering defendants at court hearings became so disruptive that the Quebec Superior Court has decided to move the trial of nine suspects to Montreal.

André Arthur, a popular local radio talk show host, has fueled the movement with harangues of oblique charges that the police are covering up evidence to keep high-placed closets closed. One of his favorite charges is that ''a certain mayor'' -- whom everyone knows to be the Quebec City mayor, Jean-Paul L'Allier -- has interfered in the investigation, although he has not offered any solid evidence.

''The stink of manure hangs over the city,'' an angry Mr. L'Allier said at a news conference earlier this year. ''If you're not in the crowd who wants to string people up from the strongest branch in the village, you're guilty by association.''

The frenzy has stretched as far away as Montreal, where demonstrators have now turned up to protest public statements by the defense lawyer for one of the suspected pimps, who said prostitution was a natural part of Haitian culture -- apparently an excuse for some of the suspected members of the ring.

The brouhaha began in earnest soon after the police broke up the ring one year ago this week. ''Since the beginning, we have said well-known persons could be implicated,'' Constable Jean-François Vézina, the Quebec City police spokesman, was quoted as saying in February.

After a court hearing in September, Roger Ferland, a police detective, said investigators had heard about provincial cabinet members who were clients of the ring but did not have the time and witnesses to build cases against them.

''There were ministers among her clients,'' Detective Ferland said in court while paraphrasing the words of one defendant heard on a wiretap of a conversation she had with her twin sister.

But the sister has disputed his account of the conversation, and police officials say their evidence does not lead them to establish the involvement of any past or current cabinet minister. The Quebec Justice Department has come to the same conclusion following an inquiry.

Still, the rumors fly.

''This is an 'X-Files' syndrome; pure paranoia,'' said Tommy Chouinard, a political reporter based here for the Montreal daily Le Devoir. He noted that the scandal had filled a void in the public debate once occupied by the issue of sovereignty, which has cooled in recent years.

She will be discreet, loving, generous and uninterested in personal gain.''

Ms. Sahagún, who resigned her post as spokeswoman today, helped orchestrate Mr. Fox's stunning rise to power, helping him become the first opposition politician in 71 years to take control of the government from the Institutional Revolutionary Party. A former English teacher who never attended college, she had been Mr. Fox's chief spokeswoman since his days as governor of Guanajuato. Known as the president's companion, she spoke openly in the press about being in love with her boss.

As the president's companion, Ms. Sahagún was a topic of titillating newspaper and cocktail party gossip. Recent reports that the president's spokeswoman was living with her boss in Los Pinos aggravated the conservative sensibilities of religious leaders and members of Mr. Fox's pro-Catholic political party.

Although people close to them have said both Mr. Fox and Ms. Sahagún are seeking to have their previous marriages annulled, leaders of the Catholic Church in Mexico publicly urged the president to reconcile with his former wife. For more than a century, Mexico had some of the strictest laws to prohibit the church's involvement in political affairs. A series of changes in 1992 loosened some restrictions, allowing priests or nuns to vote and wear religious dress in public.

The growing influence of the church under Mr. Fox's government is one of several controversies that are battering his administration a year after he won the presidency. As the economy has slumped, Mr. Fox has also seen his impressive popularity ratings dip below 70 percent a few times in recent weeks.

Talking to reporters on Thursday, the president referred obliquely to his political troubles. And speaking over their heads to the public, Mr. Fox said: ''I need the honeymoon to go on. Don't divorce me.''

As far as Mr. Fox's real honeymoon with Ms. Sahagún, no details were announced today. At a news conference with President José María Aznar of Spain, Mr. Fox blushed when the visitor congratulated him on the marriage. But Mr. Fox refused to offer details about the marriage when a reporter asked whether Mr. Fox would be granted an annulment from his previous marriage so that he and Ms. Sahagún could be married in church.

''Those are personal matters,'' Mr. Fox said. Responding to a question about how marriage suits him, Mr. Fox added, ''Just look at my smiling face and you be the judge.''

Ms. Sahagún, a mother of three children, grew up in a middle-class family, the daughter of a doctor and a homemaker. Her childhood role models were saints. She dropped out of high school to be married, but later returned to school and graduated. She left her first husband after joining Mr. Fox's conservative National Action Party, and she has devoted herself to Mr. Fox's political ambitions since she began working for him when he was governor.

Although she will no longer be Mr. Fox's spokeswoman, few experts said she would fade into the inconspicuous and powerless roles played by previous Mexican first ladies.

Some experts, citing Ms. Sahagún's devotion to Mr. Fox, have compared her to Eva Perón of Argentina.

''Perhaps she was underqualified as a spokeswoman,'' a political expert, Denise Dresser, said of Ms. Sahagún. ''I think she is overqualified for the traditional role of first lady and will try to redefine it.''",2018-02-11 00:36:02.218662,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Fox's Marriage Is a Major Personal and Political Step,Ginger Thompson,,[''],,,,nytimes

3574,5703205.0,powerlineblog.com,unknown,https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/05/the-ap-attacks-voter-id.php,"The Associated Press is generally a mouthpiece for Democratic Party talking points. That is the case as to voter ID, as this rather pathetic piece shows: “In Wisconsin, ID law proved insurmountable for many voters.”

State Sen. Mary Lazich was adamant: The bill Republicans were about to push through the Wisconsin state Senate, requiring that voters present identification at the polls, would do no harm. “Not a single voter in this state will be disenfranchised by the ID law,” Lazich promised. Five years later, in the first presidential election held under the new law, Gladys Harris proved her wrong.

So the AP makes it clear from the beginning that its article is intended as a refutation of Republican claims, and a defense of the Democrats’ position on voter ID. Let’s see how well the Associated Press makes the Democratic Party’s case.

By one estimate, 300,000 eligible voters in the state lacked valid photo IDs heading into the election; it is unknown how many people did not vote because they didn’t have proper identification.

But wait! The AP’s headline says that Wisconsin’s voter ID law “proved insurmountable for many voters.” The obvious question is: how many? The reporter now tells us that the number of people who didn’t vote because they lacked proper ID is “unknown.” The article identifies exactly four.

Next, one wonders about the source of the estimate that 300,000 eligible voters didn’t have legal ID “heading into the election.” It apparently comes from the far-left web site Think Progress, which in turn evidently derived the figure from competing expert witness affidavits that were filed in a lawsuit that challenged the voter ID law.

Those affidavits, one of which you can read here, were filed in early 2012. So Wisconsin voters who didn’t have any of the seven forms of identification permitted by the statute (including a free photo ID issued by the state, of course) had four and a half years to obtain one. The AP’s statement that 300,000 legal voters (one of the experts gave a much lower number) didn’t have proper identification “heading into the election” is deliberately misleading.

Moreover, the federal courts ultimately upheld the Wisconsin law, rejecting the claims that were made by its critics–a fact that the AP never mentions.

The Wisconsin law provides that if a would-be voter doesn’t have any of the seven forms of identification permitted by the law, he or she can cast a provisional ballot and return with proper ID within a few days, in which case the vote counts. This fact is inconvenient for the Democrats and the Associated Press, but the AP does its best with the four (4) instances it has uncovered.

* The first would-be voter allegedly lost her driver’s license shortly before the election. It sounds like she didn’t cast a provisional ballot. If she did, the AP gives no explanation for why she failed to return to the polling place to validate her ballot.

* The second presented a driver’s license from another state, and was too busy to return to the polls to validate a provisional ballot.

* The third, who was dying of cancer, had an expired driver’s license. She was told during the early voting period that she should get a new license, but the DMV station was 15 miles away, so she didn’t do it.

* The fourth had a student ID that didn’t meet the Wisconsin law’s standards. She went to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get a valid ID, but “her work schedule at a Starbucks prevented her from going to the county clerk’s office with the ID so her vote would count.”

This is not exactly an impressive catalog of voter suppression.

If voter fraud were not a risk, no voter security measures would be necessary. The AP dutifully spouts the Democratic Party line on voter fraud:

Supporters of voter ID laws say that prohibiting out-of-state driver’s licenses reduces the possibility of voter fraud and individuals filling out multiple ballots. Research has shown that such voter fraud can happen, but it’s very rare.

Really? Let’s see that “research”! Maybe it, too, comes from “Think Progress.”

Is voter fraud rarer than the four dubious instances cited in this AP article? Here in Minnesota, hundreds or thousands of instances of voter fraud have been documented, where the name, date and polling place of the person committing fraud has been pinpointed. And that is a drop in the bucket compared with the number who commit fraud but are not caught. Is there any reason to believe that Wisconsin was different before it adopted better voter security procedures?

The AP tries to suggest the President Trump carried Wisconsin because legitimate voters were foiled by the state’s voter ID law:

Overall, nearly 3 million people in Wisconsin voted last November, about 91,000 fewer than in 2012. Milwaukee, a power center for Democrats, reported that 41,000 fewer people voted there than in 2012.

So overall turnout in Wisconsin was flat, as it was in a number of states. And votes cast in many “power center(s) for Democrats” across the U.S. were down, because Hillary Clinton was an awful candidate. The AP never considers the possibility that Wisconsin’s voter ID law may have deterred some fraudulent ballots from being cast, thereby lowering vote totals.

The remarkable thing about the Democrats’ attack on Wisconsin’s voter ID law is how feeble it is. The Associated Press gives us absolutely no reason to doubt that the courts were correct in upholding the statute.",2017-11-27T01:15:02.476695,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,The AP Attacks Voter ID,Posted On,,[''],,,,

While many of them are not as challenging as you might imagine, this one is certainly going to get you scratching your head. It is a simple drawing that will make you look twice, three times or four times. It is that confusing. The simple sketch was popular back in the 1980s and was recently posted to Reddit where it went viral overnight.

Just take a look at the image with one question in mind – how many legs does this elephant have? Does it have four like normal elephants? Or more like some kind of alien critter? Check it out below and tell me what you see in the comments below now!

Although the image has been debated at length in the discussion forums of Reddit and other websites, people cannot determine the number of legs on this mammal. It is confusing and uncertain.

Because the picture is sketched in black and white, men and women have numerous answers for it. While common sense tells us that there should be one leg, other people insist that the elephant has more than that – namely five legs.

But the true answer might make you angry. Take a closer look at the picture, because this elephant has only one leg.

People have shared their reasons why. But it seems clear if you look at it. Many of the legs are only half drawn. They are made to look complete but they’re not. The upper part of the limb starts the sketch but it doesn’t finish. Instead the feet are drawn in the “negative” space, which makes it very confusing for people.

Nevertheless, explanations have come in droves. Here was one:

“The reason you’ve having trouble with this image is due to the fact that the artist responsible for this image was very clever. The only correct elephant leg in the drawing is the back left leg. That leg is completely intact, but the others aren’t. If you look very closely, you’ll see that the rest of the legs have the foot missing from them. Basically, the artist chopped the feet off of the legs and put the images of the feet between the actual legs. Look closely at the image and you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about.”

Although this is a very convincing answer, many people refuse to believe that an elephant can have fewer than four legs. They don’t care if the legs don’t have feet.

Readers on MailOnline shared their reaction to the elephant drawing:

“This picture was doing the rounds when I was at school, about 100 years before the Internet was even a twinkle in old Tim Berners-Lee’s eye!” “I can see 4 legs but the way the gaps between them have been drawn it is to deceive the viewer that there are 5.”

How many legs do you see on this elephant?

247,286.0,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/a-first-graders-answer-to-teachers-puzzle-of-the-day-has-the-internet-in-stitches/,"First-grade teacher Bret Turner was just thinking of a way to engage his precocious students over the holidays. He gave his class a tricky riddle to solve over the break, thinking no one would be able to solve it, but giving their brains something to grapple with none-the-less. However, he and most of the Twitter world were as surprised as ever to find out that some kids actually do have all the answers to the most complex issues in life.

Turner should know a thing or two about what young kids are capable of. He is a 37-year old teacher living in the San Fransisco Bay Area who has spent the past seven years teaching first- and second- graders. He actually has a real love for riddles because of the conceptual work it makes kids do. It is a Turner tradition to start each week with a different kind of riddle and let’s the kids grapple with it and seek and answer.

This one particular week the riddle went like this: “I am the beginning of everything, the end of everywhere. I am the beginning of eternity, and the end of time and space. Who am I?”

The first one to guess the riddle gave an impressively deep answer: death.

While the whole room fell silent over the answer, it was in fact not the right one! Turner took to Twitter to share the surprising turn of events. He mentioned that an “awed, somber, reflective hush fell over the class” when the word was written out on the board. Clearly, it was a lot for young kids to consider the realities of such an immense concept as death.

In that moment, Turner did not want to reveal the actual correct answer to the riddle, was is the letter ‘e’.

“This was a very typical first-grade moment; guesses to riddles are always great, and often the ‘wrong’ answers are better than the correct ones.”Turner later told the education news outlet TODAY Parents.

The first answer was not the only one to reference finitude or the nothingness present in the world. Some of the other guesses were “NOT everything”, “the end”, or even the most surprising: “nothingthing.”

What is even funnier is that when Turner actually revealed the answer to the riddle, most of the kids were not impressed. Perhaps it had to do with the grammatical nature of the joke, a reference to word-play that is likely lost on 7 and 8-year-olds.

According to Turner, the collection of answers pertaining to death was actually indicative of the topics that young kids often speak about. He points out that young kids face death on a regular basis, whether in the form of aging grandparents or a dying pet. They are just as fascinated by it as anyone, and take pleasure in seeking some resolution to it finally happening.

While it might no be a surprise to Turner, it sure is a surprise to most of us who imagine our kids talking about playing outside and imaginary worlds. The un-groundedness of kids is something we assume without paying attention to all the different things they like to speak about – including death.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,A First-Grader’s Answer To Teacher’s Puzzle Of The Day Has The Internet In Stitches,Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,

Trinity Gay, 15, was killed Sunday in the parking lot of a restaurant in Lexington, Kentucky. She was the daughter of three time track Olympian Tyson Gay. (Photo: Mark Maloney / Lexington Herald-Leader)

Trinity Gay, the daughter of Olympian Tyson Gay, was 15 years old when she died on Sunday from a stray bullet that hit her outside a restaurant in Lexington, Kentucky. Now, as her family mourns, they’re praying for the families of the people accused of pulling the trigger.

“The family appreciates the outpouring of support during the loss of our beautiful Trinity,” Gay’s family said in a statement released Monday. “She will be truly missed by all. She touched so many people on so many different levels. We ask for your continued prayers and privacy during this difficult time.”

“We are a family that believes in love and forgiveness. We are also asking for prayers for the 3 men accused and their families during what is also a difficult time for them,” they said.

According to Lexington Police, Gay was shot outside the Cook Out restaurant just before 4 a.m. Sunday. People in two cars were firing at each other before driving off. Trinity Gay was hit by the stray bullet as she stood in the parking lot. Her friends got her in a car and drove her to the hospital, where she later died.

Three men have been charged in the shooting: Dvonta Middlebrooks, 21, has been charged with wanton endangerment and possession of a firearm by a felon; Chazerae Taylor, 38, and his 19-year-old son D’markeo Taylor were also charged with wanton endangerment. The three men pleaded not guilty. Police questioned another man who was not charged.

At a candlelight vigil Monday night at Lexington High School, three time Olympian Tyson Gay condemned the violence that took his daughter’s life.

“I don’t want to read in the paper next week about another senseless killing,” he said. “It has to stop.”

Gay said his daughter was always happy, and that she’d have wanted others to protect each other, no matter what. She was a track star at Lexington High School. People hung pairs of track spikes from a fence at Monday night’s vigil.

251,291.0,breakpoint.org,unreliable,http://breakpoint.org/2018/01/breakpoint-sweet-cakes-melissa-religious-freedom-lose-appeal/,"The state of Oregon told a pair of bakers to make the cake or eat a ruinous fine. And sadly, a federal court agreed.

Now stop me if you’ve heard this before: A same-sex couple asks a local bakery to make a wedding cake. The bakers, who are Christians, decline to do so on the grounds that it would violate their religious convictions.

The couple, feeling deeply aggrieved, files a complaint. The state civil rights agency finds for the same-sex couple and, in effect, forces the bakers to choose between their faith and their livelihood.

If you noticed my use of plural nouns so far, you may have guessed that I’m not talking about Jack Phillips, whose case was recently argued before the Supreme Court. No, this time I’m talking about Sweet Cakes by Melissa, and its owners, Aaron and Melissa Klein.

Not only did the Oregon Labor Commissioner rule against the Kleins, he imposed a ruinous fine on them of $135,000. A fine that high is the Commissioner telling the Kleins, not only are you wrong, you’re evil. You need to be put out of business.

The Kleins appealed the ruling to the Oregon Court of Appeals, and last month the Court upheld the Oregon Labor Commissioner. While the outcome wasn’t surprising—Oregon is a very liberal state after all—there are some aspects of the opinion that are worth noting.

First is what wasn’t said by the court. There were no comparisons to Nazis or racists, nor were there were references to Jim Crow. That separates this ruling from that of a federal judge in Telescope Media Group v. Lindsey.

That case involved two Christian videographers, Carl and Angel Larsen, who challenged parts of Minnesota’s “Human Rights Act” that would require them to service same-sex weddings. They sought the right to post a notice on their website about their policy concerning same-sex weddings.

The Federal District Court rejected their arguments and then said that what the Larsens were proposing to do was “conduct akin to a ‘White Applicants Only’ sign.”

Now thankfully, the Oregon Court of Appeals didn’t make any such crazy comparisons. Unlike the federal court in Minnesota, it took the Kleins’ claims to freedom of artistic expression seriously.

But its reasoning was tortured. It acknowledged that “the Kleins imbue each wedding cake with their own aesthetic choices,” but then added the strange and nebulous line that the Kleins “have made no showing that other people will necessarily experience any wedding cake that the Kleins create predominantly as ‘expression’ rather than as food.”

So for the Court, what makes something “art” is that they are “both intended to be and are experienced predominantly (whatever that means) as expression.”

Say what? This reasoning is nonsensical. Last May, a college student from Scotland left a pineapple on a table at a museum, and visitors treated it as if it were on display. A year earlier, a 17-year-old left a pair of glasses on the floor of a San Francisco art gallery and people stood around and took pictures of it. The Guardian called it “a work of genius.”

So pineapples and eyeglasses can be experienced as “art,” even “works of genius,” but a cake specifically designed for the context of a wedding might not be?

Look, the Court pulled this “standard” out of thin air. It was a case of, to borrow a line from Lewis Carroll, “sentence first, verdict afterwards.” The Court realized that making a cake for an event could definitely be speech, but they couldn’t allow this speech or those who made it to prevail, so it created a reason why they shouldn’t.

The fact that it’s impossible to imagine this standard being applied in any other context, or to any other direct speech, only underscores this fact.

And as I close, please visit BreakPoint.org for a special symposium. Hear what folks like Os Guinness, Ryan Anderson, Mindy Belz and others have to say about the challenges facing the Church in 2018. Again, that’s BreakPoint.org.

""That is directly related to governance; that is not a private-life issue.""

The testiness reached a peak when the two attacked each other over who on their campaign staffs was chiefly responsible for spreading rumors about extramarital affairs involving each man. And that prompted Mr. Pressman, who at times struggled to keep decorum, to blurt out, ""Let me blow the whistle on this chapter.""

And for the next 20 minutes or so, the two clashed in a way familiar to New Jersey voters: on property taxes, corruption and other policy issues. But when Mr. Pressman asked Mr. Corzine if he supported lowering the drinking age, he was caught off guard.

Mr. Corzine, looking flustered, did not know that the age was 21, but said that he did not have a problem with lowering it to 18, considering that men and women that young are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. But after the debate, when pressed by reporters, he backtracked and said that he did not support lowering the age.

""I wish I had been better prepared,"" he said. ""I was focused on the 18-year-olds serving in Iraq.""

His campaign also released a statement after the debate, repeating Mr. Corzine's opposition and noting that he had fought in the United States Senate to strengthen the nation's drunken-driving laws.

How much impact the debate will have remains to be seen. But with the polls offering widely varying results on how much a lead Mr. Corzine has, from 2 percentage points to 12, both candidates are expected to pour even more of their own fortunes into a race that has cost them a combined $72 million so far.

What also remains to be seen is how much effect the last-minute personal accusations, fanned not only by both campaigns, but also by reporters, will have on voters, who consistently say in surveys that they are disgusted by the nastiness of the race.

In the beginning, at least, last night's debate had the makings of a civilized discussion. With Mr. Pressman in the middle, the candidates sat down around a table, and expressed the hope that the voters would focus on the issues, not the gossip.

But as the debate wore on, a visual tactic that WNBC employed seemed all the more fitting: splitting the screen so that Mr. Corzine was on the left, and Mr. Forrester on the right. And while Mr. Corzine sometimes appeared to be uncomfortable or irritated, as he scribbled notes furiously, Mr. Forrester sometimes appeared to be incredulous, as he raised his eyebrows over and over again.

The two interrupted each other frequently. Sometimes they tried to talk over each other, making it hard to figure out who was talking, and why.

At one point, Mr. Corzine even held up his hand, as if in protest, and said, ""Please! Please!"" At another, after Mr. Pressman beseeched Mr. Forrester to yield the floor, Mr. Forrester said, ""I'll yield the conversation, but I won't yield the state of New Jersey.""

The two candidates did agree on few things, one of them being the good job that the United States attorney, Christopher J. Christie, a Republican, had done in trying to root out corruption.

But mainly, they clashed, and clashed more. Mr. Forrester said that Mr. Corzine had had five years in the Senate to help clean up New Jersey's problems, but that because he was so intimately connected with Democratic power brokers, he had been ineffective.

To which Mr. Corzine said, ""I've been a United States senator, not a state senator.""

Mr. Corzine also defended his record in the Senate, noting that he was one of 23 senators to oppose the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. And, just as he has done throughout the campaign, he tried to tie Mr. Forrester to President Bush, whose popularity has sagged in the state.

Given the negative nature of the campaign, it was perhaps appropriate that Mr. Pressman asked why either man wanted the job.

Mr. Corzine said that ""if you want to be held accountable for real property tax relief, if you want to be held accountable to make sure that we get real reform, then being a governor is where the action is.""

And when Mr. Pressman asked Mr. Forrester if water polo -- a sport at which he excelled -- had prepared him for politics, Mr. Forrester was introspective, even poetic.

At least that was the case at the benefit produced by the City Winery owner Michael Dorf on Tuesday night at Carnegie Hall, where dozens of musicians joined a tribute to the Rolling Stones. Performing all 21 tracks from the band's classic collected-hits album, ''Hot Rocks 1964-1971,'' on the 40th anniversary of its release, the ladies were the ones with Mick Jagger's cocky strut and sex appeal, not to mention the outr?utfits.

Peaches, the Canadian club singer, took the stage in a tight black hooded jumpsuit, open nearly to the navel, and swung the microphone through a rendition of ''Heart of Stone,'' her expanse of bare flesh turning pink as she panted feelingly through the chorus. The singer and actress Juliette Lewis, in silver sequined hot pants and with occasionally pursed lips, had women dancing in the aisles with her version of ''Satisfaction.'' She doffed her high heels -- also silver sequined -- halfway through.

The petite Ang?que Kidjo, from Benin, in West Africa, in a tuxedo, head wrap and pearlescent pumps, kicked and stomped and shimmied during ''Street Fighting Man,'' coaxing the crowd to its feet. Rickie Lee Jones stayed seated with her guitar for ''Sympathy for the Devil,'' but she too took off her silver flats as she tapped and fought her way into the song, inspiring audience members to supply their own woo-woos for the chorus.

The event, the eighth in an annual series to benefit children's musical charities, was, like its predecessors, a mix of young and old musicians, some with obvious ties to the Stones, like Marianne Faithfull and Ronnie Spector, onetime musical and romantic partners of Mr. Jagger or Keith Richards. There were also 1960s and '70s contemporaries like Art Garfunkel, David Johansen (the closest to Mr. Jagger in visage and pants tightness) and Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople. The show opened with a rendition of ''You Can't Always Get What You Want'' by the Italian pop star Jovanotti and members of the band TV on the Radio, along with a youth choir from Young Audiences New York, a neat reminder of the sweet voices that begin the original song and the reason for the benefit.

Many of the renditions were loyal and personal: Ms. Faithfull performed ''As Tears Go By,'' which Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards wrote for her, and ''Sister Morphine,'' which she wrote with Mr. Jagger; Steve Earle chose ''Mother's Little Helper'' because, he said, it was the first song he learned on guitar. Others offered minimal arrangements, like the Mountain Goats' ''Paint It, Black,'' on piano and drums. Glen Hansard, the Irish singer and composer behind the forthcoming Broadway musical ''Once,'' did ''Under My Thumb'' on his guitar, accompanied only by an upright bass and snapping from the audience.

But the evening's mood could have been summed up by Ms. Spector. Still rocking a bouffant, Ms. Spector, the former Ronette, brought some girl-group harmonies and classic swagger to the stage. She played flirtatiously with her shirttails, shook her hips and roared, effortlessly, through ''Time Is on My Side.'' MELENA RYZIK

254,294.0,breakpoint.org,unreliable,http://breakpoint.org/2018/01/breakpoint-stories-that-encourage-inspire-restore/,"Madeleine L’Engle said, “Stories make us more alive, more human, more courageous, more loving.” They also can make us more faithful.

When the prophet Nathan wanted to bring David to repentance, he didn’t cite the Law on adultery; he told the king a story. When Jesus wanted to show a lawyer what kind of heart God requires of those who would inherit eternal life, He told the man a parable of the Good Samaritan. When Jewish people think about what it means to be a Jew, they return to the stories of God’s saving acts in Egypt and afterwards. Do you sense a pattern here?

An old proverb says, “Tell me the facts and I’ll learn. Tell me the truth and I’ll believe. But tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever.” As we’ve said before on BreakPoint, the Bible isn’t primarily a theological textbook, or even a legal code—though it has plenty of both of these elements. No, it comes to us as the Grand Story of God’s working in history. Through it, we look back and see what God has done, which enables us to look ahead and see what God will do—all while placing ourselves as responsible participants in God’s glorious plan to redeem all things.

The Bible’s story of creation, fall, redemption, and restoration has fired the imaginations and strengthened the limbs of countless believers in diverse cultural moments, inspiring them to heal the sick, open the eyes of the blind, found universities, discover the universe’s secrets, free the enslaved, cross the oceans, and otherwise follow God’s call. That’s what the Christian story does.

And, it encourages us to tell the world our stories about the Lord working through His people, and not just the famous ones. It’s easy to think “Well, I’m no Colson. I’m no Wilberforce.” That’s why this year, we’re committed to telling the stories of those people of whom you’ve never heard. And we could use your help.

My colleague, Warren Cole Smith, is spearheading this effort. His new series, named “Restoring All Things” after the book that he and I wrote together a few years ago, will highlight the stories of followers of Jesus making a difference in their communities and around the nation.

In a recent article, Warren tells the story of Colin Pinkney, who runs The Harvest Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Colin is the seventh of nine children, and his father abandoned his family when he was just nine years old. “Fatherhood is the silver bullet, if there is one,” Colin says. “It’s clear there is a fathering issue in our nation.”

Colin now has six children himself, and his office bookshelf is filled with volumes on fathering. When he was the president of the PTA at his children’s school, Colin led a seminar on effective fathering, and more than 100 people showed up.

Now, at the Harvest Center on Charlotte’s west side, Colin leads a full-time staff of 12 and oversees a budget of $850,000. Four thousand people a year get help there. Many become self-sufficient.

How much government money does Colin accept? “Zero,” he answers, emphatically. He models his ministry on, you guessed it, a story—the one found in John 5 in which Jesus heals a man lame for 38 years. Before He does so, however, Jesus asks him, “Do you want to be made whole?”

“I always think of that story as we evaluate our work,” Colin says. “We’re asking tough questions. We have to reeducate this community to a better way than what they’ve been receiving in the past.” You see, what he’s doing is teaching people a different story than what they’ve known up to this point.

(Before It's News)

I hate to even report this, and the fact of the matter is, it’s disappointing considering what we all know about PEDs use and baseball at this point. Sad news. Ervin Santana has been suspended for 80 games for using PEDs. Ervin is one of my followers on Twitter, so this makes it even more disappointing to report this tonight.

According to Hardball Talk:

“The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball announced today that Minnesota Twins right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana has received an 80-game suspension without pay after testing positive for Stanozolol, a performance-enhancing substance, in violation of Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The suspension of Santana will be effective for the first 80 games of the 2015 regular season.”

Santana put out a statement. Here’s a portion of it:

“…I serve as a role model for many kids in my home country who dream of playing at the highest level. I would never put baseball, my family, or my country in a position where its integrity is jeopardized. I preach hard work, and don’t believe in short cuts. I am very disappointed that I tested positive for a performance enhancing drug. I am frustrated that I can’t pinpoint how the substance in question entered my body. I would never knowingly take anything illegal to enhance my performance. What I can guarantee is I never knowingly took anything illegal to enhance my performance. That’s just not me, never has been and never will.” “Moving forward, I need to be more careful on what I consume in my home country, I will be more vigilant of medications I take so that I don’t commit another mistake…”

I don’t know. I personally like the guy, but he messed up and caught red handed. I guess he does his suspension and we move on.

Unreal…

9242,7677012.0,rinf.com,political,http://rinf.com/alt-news/contributions/general/noam-chomsky-on-marijuana/,"By John Veit – HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE | A hundred years from now, Avram Noam Chomsky is going to figure in the history books as the prime voice of conscience, dissent and reason in the wars and social catastrophes of the late 20th century. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s, he began an intellectual revolution in the understanding of linguistics which very efficiently challenged and subverted the old knee-jerk behavioristic worldview that nourished the Cold War. His seamless critical essays on American foreign and domestic policies since then have unerringly diagnosed their fallacies, relentlessly dissecting the propaganda of the power establishment. We thought it was time he addressed the Drug War.

HIGH TIMES: You’ve defined the War on Drugs as an instrument of population control. How does it accomplish that?



NOAM CHOMSKY: Population control is actually a term I borrowed from the counterinsurgency literature of the Kennedy years. The main targets at the time were Southeast Asia and Latin America, where there was an awful lot popular ferment. They recognized that the population was supporting popular forces that were calling for all kinds of social change that the United States simply could not tolerate. And you could control people in a number of ways. One way was just by terror and violence, napalm bombing and so on, but they also worked on developing other kinds of population-control measures to keep people subjugated, ranging from propaganda to concentration camps. Propaganda is much more effective when it is combined with terror.

You have the same problem domestically, where the public is constantly getting out of control. You have to carry out measures to insure that they remain passive and apathetic and obedient, and don’t interfere with privilege and power. It’s a major theme of modern democracy. As the mechanisms of democracy expand, like enfranchisement and growth, the need to control people by other means increases.

So the growth of corporate propaganda in the United States more or less parallels the growth of democracy, for quite straightforward reasons. It’s not any kind of secret. It is discussed very frankly and openly in business literature and academic social-science journals. You have to “fight the everlasting battle for the minds of men,” in their standard phraseology, to indoctrinate and regiment them in the way that armies regiment their bodies. Those are population-control measures. This engineering or manufacture of consent is the essence of democracy, because you have to insure that ignorant and meddlesome outsiders – meaning, we, the people – don’t interfere with the work of the serious people who run public affairs in the interests of the privileged.

HIGH TIMES: How does the War on Drugs fit into this?



NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, one of the traditional and obvious ways of controlling people in every society, whether it’s a military dictatorship or a democracy, is to frighten them. If people are frightened, they’ll be willing to cede authority to their superiors who will protect them: “OK, I’ll let you run my life in order to protect me,” that sort of reasoning.

So the fear of drugs and fear of crime is very much stimulated by state and business propaganda. The National Justice Commission repeatedly points out that crime in the United States, while sort of high, is not off the spectrum for industrial societies. On the other hand, fear of crime is far beyond other societies, and mostly stimulated by various forms of propaganda. The Drug War is an effort to stimulate fear of dangerous people from whom we have to protect ourselves. It is also a direct form of control of what are called the “dangerous classes,” those superfluous people who don’t really have a function contributing to profit-making and wealth. They have to be somehow taken care of.

HIGH TIMES: In some other countries you just hang the rabble.



NOAM CHOMSKY: Yes, but in the U.S. you don’t kill them, you put them in jail. The economic policies of the 1980s sharply increased inequality, concentrating such economic growth as there was, which was not enormous, in very few hands. The top few percent of the population got extremely wealthy as profits went through the roof, and meanwhile median-income wages were stagnating or declining. People have to work harder, and public support systems for poor and hungry people have been declining sharply ever since the ’70s. You’re getting a large mass of people who are insecure, suffering from difficulty or misery, or something in between. A lot of them basically are going to be arrested, because you have to control them.

The Drug War is used for that purpose. It very explicitly targets young black males. When the War on Drugs was re-declared in the late ’80s, Senator Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) pointed out that if you just look at social statistics, you can see that we are calling for a war against poor minorities, black males basically.

HIGH TIMES: It’s obviously true, but how do you prove it?



NOAM CHOMSKY: Just by looking at the trend lines for marijuana. Marijuana use was peaking in the late ’70s, but there was not much criminalization. You didn’t go to jail for life for having marijuana then because the people using it were nice folks like us, the children of the rich. You don’t throw them into jail any more than you throw corporate executives in jail – even though corporate crime is far more costly and dangerous than street crime. But then in the ’80s the use of various “unhealthy” substances started to decline among more educated sectors: marijuana and tobacco smoking, alcohol, red meat, coffee, this whole category of stuff. On the other hand, usage remained steady among poorer sectors of the population. In the United States, poor and black correlate – they’re not identical, but there’s a correlation – and in poor, black and Hispanic sectors of the population the use of such substances remained pretty steady.

So take a look at those trend lines. When you call for a War on Drugs, you know exactly who you are going to pick up: poor black people. You’re not going to pick up rich white people; you don’t go after them anyway. In the upper-middle-class suburb where I live, if somebody goes home and sniffs some cocaine the police don’t break into their house.

So there are many factors making the Drug War a war against the poor, largely poor people of color. And those are the people they have to get rid of. During the period these economic policies were being instituted, the incarceration rate was shooting up, but crime wasn’t, it was steady or declining. But imprisonment went way up. By the late ’80s, in terms of imprisoning our population, we were way ahead of the rest of the world, way ahead of any other industrial society.

HIGH TIMES: Who benefits from incarcerating young black males?



NOAM CHOMSKY: A lot of people. Poor people are basically superfluous for wealth production, and therefore the wealthy want to get rid of them. The rich also frighten everyone else, because if you’re afraid of these people, then you submit to state authority. But beyond that, it’s a state industry. Since the 1930s, every businessman has understood that a private capitalist economy must have massive state subsidies; the only question is what form that state subsidy will take. In the United States the main form has been through the military system. The most dynamic aspects of the economy – computers, the Internet, the aeronautical industry, pharmaceuticals – have fed off the military system. But the crime-control industry, as it’s called by criminologists, is becoming the fastest-growing industry in America.

And it’s a state industry, publicly funded. It’s the construction industry, the real-estate industry, and also high-tech firms. It’s gotten to a scale sufficient that high-technology and military contractors are looking to it as a market for techniques of high-tech control and surveillance, so you can monitor what people do in their private activities with complicated electronic devices and supercomputers: monitoring their telephone calls and urinalyses and so forth. In fact, the time will probably come when this superfluous population can be locked up in private apartments, not jails, and just monitored to track when they do the wrong thing, say the wrong thing, go the wrong direction.

HIGH TIMES: House arrest for the masses.



It’s enough of an industry so that the major defense-industry firms are interested; you can read about it in The Wall Street Journal. The big law firms and investment houses are interested: Merrill Lynch is floating big loans for prison construction. If you take the whole system, it’s probably approaching the scale of the Pentagon.

Also, this is a terrific workforce. We hear a fuss about prison labor in China, but prison labor is standard here. It’s very cheap, it doesn’t organize, the workers don’t ask for rights, you don’t have to worry about health benefits because the public is paying for everything. It’s what’s called a “flexible” workforce, the kind of thing economists like; you have the workers when you want them, and you throw them out when you don’t want them.

And what’s more, it’s an old American tradition. There was a big industrial revolution in parts of the South in the early part of this century, in northern Georgia and Kentucky and Alabama, and it was based mostly around prison labor. The slaves had been technically freed, but after a few years they were basically slaves again. One way of controlling them was to throw them in jail, where they became a controlled labor force. That’s the core of the modern industrial revolution in the South, which continued in Georgia to the 1920s and to the Second World War in places like Mississippi. (It should be noted that when “involuntary servitude” was abolished, the only exception was criminals convicted of crimes. WFI Editor)

Now it’s being revived. In Oregon and California there’s a fairly substantial textile industry in the prisons, with exports to Asia. At the very time people were complaining about prison labor in China, California and Oregon are exporting prison-made textiles to China. They even have a line called, “Prison Blues.”

And it goes all the way up to advanced technology like data processing. In the state of Washington, Boeing workers are protesting the export of jobs to China, but they’re probably unaware that their jobs are being exported to nearby prisons, where machinists are doing work for Boeing under circumstances that the management is delighted over, for obvious reasons.

HIGH TIMES: And most of these prisoners are now nonviolent drug offenders.



NOAM CHOMSKY: The enormous rate of growth of the prison population has been mostly drug-related. The last figures I saw showed that over half the federal prison population, and maybe a quarter in state prisons, are drug offenders. In New York State, for example, a twenty-dollar street sale or possession of an ounce of cocaine will get you the same sentence as arson with intent to murder. The three-strikes legislation is going to blow it right through the sky. The third arrest can be for some minor drug offense, and you’ll go to jail forever. (Another side effect of the three-strikes laws has been a dramatic increase in the number of high-speed police car chases, and car-chase-related car accidents. Knowing that they are up against a life sentence, even petty criminals try to escape now, instead of surrendering. WFI Editor)

HIGH TIMES: The Drug Czar’s office estimates that Americans spend $$57 billion annually on illegal drugs. What effect does this have on the global economy?



NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, the United Nations tries to monitor the international drug trade, and their estimates are on the order of $$400 to $$500 billion – half a trillion dollars a year – in trade alone, which makes it higher than oil, something like 10 percent of world trade. Where this money goes to is mostly unknown, but general estimates are that maybe 60 % of it passes through U.S. banks. After that, a lot goes to offshore tax havens. It’s so obscure that nobody monitors it, and nobody wants to. But the Commerce Department every year publishes figures on foreign direct investment, where U.S. investment is going, and through the ’90s the big excitement has been the “new emerging markets” like Latin America. And it turns out that a quarter of U.S. foreign direct investment is going to Bermuda, another 15% to the Bahamas and Cayman Islands, another 10% to Panama, and so on. Now, they’re not building steel factories. The most benign interpretation is that it’s just tax havens. And the less benign interpretation is that it’s one way of passing illegal money into places where it will not be monitored. We really don’t know, because it is not investigated. This is not the task of the Justice Department, which is to go after a black kid in the ghetto who has a joint in his pocket.

HIGH TIMES: What do you think of the U.S. policy of offering trade and aid favors to countries who promulgate so-called anti-drug initiatives?



NOAM CHOMSKY: Actually, U.S. programs radically increase the use of drugs. Look at the big growth in cocaine production that has exploded in the Andes over the last few years, in Colombia and Peru and Bolivia. Why are Bolivian peasants, for instance, producing coca? The neo-liberal structural adjustment policies of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which are run by the U.S., try to drive peasants into agro-export, producing not for local consumption but for sale abroad. They want to reduce social programs, like spending for health and education, cutting government deficits by increasing exports. And they cut back tariffs so that we can then pour our own highly subsidized food exports into their countries, which of course, undercuts peasant production. Put all that together and what do you get? You get a huge increase in Bolivian coca production, as their only comparative advantage.

The same is true in Colombia, where U.S. “food for peace” aid, as it is called, was used to undercut or destroy wheat production by essentially giving food – at what amounts to U.S. taxpayer expense – through U.S. agro-exporters to undercut wheat production there, which later cut coffee production and their ability to set prices in any reasonable fashion. And the end result is they turn to something else, and one of the things they turn to is coca production. In fact, if you look at the total effect of U.S. policies, it has been to increase drugs.

HIGH TIMES: Well, anybody who looks into the history of American drug policies in this century…



NOAM CHOMSKY: I’m putting aside another factor altogether, namely clandestine warfare. If you look into the history of what is called the CIA, which means the U.S. White House, its secret wars, clandestine warfare, the trail of drug production just follows. It started in France after the Second World War when the United States was essentially trying to re-institute the traditional social order, to rehabilitate Fascist collaborators, wipe out the Resistance and destroy the unions and so on. The first thing they did was re-constitute the Mafia, as strikebreakers or for other such useful services. And the Mafia doesn’t do it for fun, so there was a tradeoff: Essentially, they allowed them to re-institute the heroin-production system, which had been destroyed by the Fascists. The Fascists tended to run a pretty tight ship: They didn’t want any competition, so they wiped out the Mafia. But the U.S. re-constituted it, first in southern Italy, and then in southern France with the Corsican Mafia. That’s where the famous French Connection comes from.

That was the main heroin center for many years. Then U.S. terrorist activities shifted over to Southeast Asia. If you want to carry out terrorist activities, you need local people to do it for you, and you also need secret money to pay for it, clandestine hidden money. Well, if you need to hire thugs and murderers with secret money, there aren’t many options. One of them is the drug connection. The so-called Golden Triangle around Burma, Laos and Thailand became a big drug-producing area with the help of the United States, as part of the secret wars against those populations.

In Central America, it was partly exposed in the Contra hearings, though it was mostly suppressed. But there’s no question that the Reagan administration’s terrorist operations in Central America were closely connected with drug trafficking. Afghanistan became one of the biggest centers of drug trafficking in the world in the 1980s, because that was the payoff for the forces to which the U.S. was contributing millions of dollars: the same extreme Islamic fundamentalists who are now tearing the country to shreds. It’s been true throughout the world. It’s not that the U.S. is trying to increase the use of drugs, it’s just the natural thing to do. If you were in a position where you had to hire thugs and gangsters to kill peasants and break strikes, and you had to do it with untraceable money, what would come to your mind?

HIGH TIMES: Where do you stand on drug legalization?



NOAM CHOMSKY: Nobody knows what the effect would be. Anyone who tells you they know is just stupid or lying, because nobody knows. These are things that have to be tried, you have to experiment to see what the effects are. Most soft drugs are already legal, mainly alcohol and tobacco. Tobacco is by far the biggest killer among all the psychoactives. Alcohol deaths are a little hard to estimate, because an awful lot of violent deaths are associated with alcohol. Way down below come “hard” drugs, a tiny fraction of the deaths from alcohol or tobacco, maybe ten or twenty thousand deaths per year. The fastest-growing hard drugs are the APS, amphetamine-type substances, produced mostly in the U.S.

As far as the rest of the drugs are concerned, marijuana is not known to be very harmful. I mean, it’s generally assumed it’s not good for you, but coffee isn’t good for you, tea isn’t good for you, chocolate cake isn’t good for you either. It would be crazy to criminalize coffee, even though it’s harmful. The United States is one of very few countries where this is considered a moral issue. In most countries you don’t have politicians getting up screaming about how tough they’re going to be on drugs. So the first thing we’ve got to do is move it out of the phase of population control, and into the sphere of social issues. The Rand Corporation estimates that if you compare the effect of criminal programs versus educational programs at reducing drug use, educational programs are way ahead, by about a factor of seven.

HIGH TIMES: But alarmist drug-propaganda programs like DARE and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America’s TV ads have been found to increase experimentation among teenagers.



NOAM CHOMSKY: The question is, what kind of education are you doing? Educational programs aren’t the only category. Education also has to do with the social circumstances in which drugs are used. The answer to that is not throwing people in jail. The answer is to try and figure what’s going on in their lives, their family; do they need medical care and so on? This very striking decline in substance abuse among educated sectors, as I said, goes across the spectrum – red meat, coffee, tobacco, everything. That’s education. It wasn’t that there was an educational program that said to stop drinking coffee, it’s just that attitudes toward oneself and towards health, how we live and so on, changed among the more educated sectors of the population, and these things went down. And none of it had to do with criminalization. It just had to do with a rise in the culture and educational level, which led to more care for oneself.

Because support staff are now able to return to work, President Trump’s previously scheduled trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week is able to proceed without a hitch. CNN is now reporting, however, that the first lady, Melania Trump, will not be joining him on his trip, even though the administration had previously reported that she would.

East Wing communications director Stephanie Grisham cited “scheduling and logistical issues” as the reason for Melania backing out of accompanying her husband overseas. Grisham had previously told CNN that the first lady intended to attend the World Economic Forum “in a show of support for her husband, who intends to give remarks during his visit.”

President Trump, for his part, remains a controversial figure in contexts like the World Economic Forum, having long established himself as fiercely committed to his “America First” agenda through such means as slapping protectionist tariffs on foreign goods including, most recently, solar panels.

Vocally anti-Trump solar company NOW! SOLAR was among the interests to issue a statement criticizing the president’s decision, posting that they are “devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry.”

As the company noted, Solar Energy Industries Association President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper commented that the tariffs will “create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs.”

Stunningly, the SEIA states that the tariffs “effectively will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year, including many in manufacturing, and it will result in the delay or cancellation of billions of dollars in solar investment.”

The tariffs were imposed after a complaint was filed by the two foreign-owned solar companies Suniva and SolarWorld, and they’re just one step in an already long history of the president deciding to “go it alone” instead of cooperating with our allies and accepting that foreigners aren’t all out to get us. Trump’s protectionist, anti-globalization trade policies are the economic side to his racism, which holds that numerous foreigners pose some kind of existential threat to the U.S.

Other infamous instances of the president deciding to “go it alone” include his announcement of his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, although it takes more than a belligerent announcement from the president to make that happen.

World Economic Forum President Borge Brende recently commented to CNBC that Trump would do well to remember that “you only succeed if others do well too.”

Very pleased to welcome Trump to Davos: WEF president from CNBC.

The clashing of Brende’s and Trump’s perspectives will no doubt mark the president’s time at the World Economic Forum this week. His past trips overseas have been marked by a similar clash, with him having long insisted — including while overseas — that the U.S. is doing too much on behalf of our allies and that others should do more.

OTTAWA, Ontario, 27 February, 2013 (LifeSiteNews.com) – Canada’s top court has released a unanimous decision today that critics say has struck a monumental blow against freedom of speech, opinion, and religion across the country. The court ordered the defendant, a Christian pro-family activist with a reputation for intense activism, not only to pay a fine, but also to pay court costs which could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“It’s a bad day,” said Bill Whatcott to LifeSiteNews.com in an interview. “The ruling and the reasoning [behind it] is terrible. They actually used the concept that truth is not a defense.”

“It’s worse than I expected. What it means is that my life is over, as I know it. It means that the Christian Church is going to be libel for speaking the truth,” he said.

In Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, the Supreme Court decided that born-again Christian William Whatcott was guilty of hate speech for distributing flyers to neighborhoods in Saskatoon and Regina in 2001 and 2002. While the flyers used vehement language against homosexual practices and the homosexual agenda, they did not directly attack homosexual persons. (The flyers are appended to the end of the decision linked above)

The Court focused on Whatcott’s main argument, namely that he loves homosexuals with a brotherly Christian love, and it is only their sexual activity that he denounces.

But the Supreme Court found that with regards to hate speech, the distinction between ‘sin and sinner’ no longer applies.

“I agree that sexual orientation and sexual behaviour can be differentiated for certain purposes,” the Court stated. “However, in instances where hate speech is directed toward behaviour in an effort to mask the true target, the vulnerable group, this distinction should not serve to avoid s. 14(1)(b) [the hate-crime clause of the Code].”

“Courts have recognized a strong connection between sexual orientation and sexual conduct and where the conduct targeted by speech is a crucial aspect of the identity of a vulnerable group, attacks on this conduct stand as proxy for attacks on the group itself,” the Court stated.

The Court ordered Whatcott to pay the Human Rights Commission’s legal fees and to pay $$7,500 in compensation to two homosexuals who were offended by his flyers.

Gwen Landolt, national vice-president of REAL Women of Canada, called the ruling “very depressing” and “bad news”.

Landolt accused the Supreme Court of “dancing on hot coals, one foot here and one foot there, trying to pretend that they’re doing one thing, but doing another.”

“On the one hand they’re saying, ‘Oh, no, no, no, we’re not really infringing on freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of opinion’, but in fact, what they say is not what they’ve done,” she said in an interview with LifeSiteNews.com.

“In effect, what they’ve done is they’ve hit-out at religious beliefs and promoted again, as is constantly happening, homosexual rights.”

“They’ve picked up ‘sexual orientation’ and slammed ‘religious freedom’ with it and given it a big wallop as with a baseball bat,” she said.

Landolt said that the Court has damaged freedom of religion by “manipulating and twisting” the whole intent of this freedom “to serve their own objective which is to protect homosexuals.”

She said that Christians had better take the ruling as a “warning sign” that they are going to be “pounced on” if they decide to speak about Christian sexual morality in the public square.

The Catholic Civil Rights League (CCRL) said it is concerned over the Court’s equating homosexual activity with homosexual persons.

“A key teaching of Christianity is to hate the sin, but love the sinner,” said CCRL president Phil Horgan, pointing out that as a society, “we incarcerate convicted persons for their crimes, not out of hate for the individual.”

“But with Whatcott, the SCC has stated that criticism of behaviour(s) can be treated as potentially hateful speech against the minority. Will criticism of activities at gay pride parades be treated similarly? Will criticism of certain homosexual sexual activities be now conflated as an example of hate speech of an individual or minority? This conflation of behaviour with the person or group, is a proposition at odds with most religious teachings, and of concern coming from our highest court.”

Chris Schafer, Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF) executive director and lawyer, said that the “Supreme Court missed an excellent opportunity to rein in the power of various human rights commissions and tribunals to censor the expression of unpopular beliefs and opinions.”

“Free expression is the lifeblood of democracies and all forms of expression, especially the offensive kind, needs to be protected. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court disagrees,” he said.

André Schutten, legal counsel for the Association for Reformed Political Action (ARPA), said he was disappointed with the ruling since the Court decided to “keep as constitutional” the ambiguous hate-crimes language of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, which prohibits any representation “that exposes or tends to expose to hatred” persons on the basis of a prohibited ground.

Schutten told LifeSiteNews.com that upholding such language is “problematic” since “hatred is an emotion that cannot be easily and objectively measured.”

Schutten said that the ruling means that Christians will now be “less likely to engage in political debate from their viewpoint, which means that Christians are kept out of the political process”. He said that the ruling will also hamper Christians in preaching the “full Gospel”.

“The preaching of the Gospel requires that we know what the Good News is. And the Good News is that we’re saved. But in order to understand that we are saved, we have to know what we are saved from. So, when we are preaching the Gospel, that includes preaching about sin. And sin is always going to be offensive to some people. When we talk about sin, some people will interpret that as hateful.”

Schutten said that the ruling “puts a chill on religious expression and any expression.”

Ezra Levant from Sun News has predicted that the ruling will inundate Human Rights Commissions with hate-speech based complaints.

“You will see a boom in the Human Rights Commission business because the law is so vague and the Supreme Court is saying: ‘Yeah, you can go after someone if they say something hateful’. We are going to see an explosion of hate-speech complaints out there,” he said.

Whatcott agrees. He told LifeSiteNews.com that the ruling will embolden homosexual activists to file complaints against those who raise a voice against sexual anarchy.

Despite the ruling, Whatcott said that he will continue to “publicly witness against homosexuality” since he sees it has “God’s will” in his life. The Christian activist is soliciting prayers from people of faith so that he will receive the spiritual support needed to get through this time.",2017-11-13T18:09:27.760857,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Supreme Court muzzles free speech in Canada, rules against Christian pro-family activist",Peter Baklinski,,[''],"Canada’s top court has released an unanimous decision today that critics say has struck a monumental blow against freedom of speech, opinion, and religion across the country in response to a Human Rights complaint regarding distribution of flyers decrying homosexual activity.",,,

Sadly, this man ate sushi and sashimi every single day until a massive parasite slithered out of his body.

This man was about 30 years old and from Fresno California. He was experiencing severe cramps and bloody diarrhea when he decided a trip to the ER was in order. The Washington Post recently did an interview with an emergency physician at the University of California at San Francisco who treated this unfortunate man.

The name of this emergency physician is Kenny Banh and boy did he have a story to share. You can click here to hear Banh speak on the podcast “This Won’t Hurt a Bit.” Hanh said that the man came in wanting to get treated for ‘worms.’ This man had a bag with some of his worm inside of it. This worm was wrapped around a toilet paper roll and when it was stretched out measured almost 6 foot long!

When asked how he was able to extract the worm this man told Bahn that he was having some problems in the bathroom and noticed a piece of what he thought was intestine hanging out of his bum. He began pulling on it and it just kept coming and coming. While the worm was dead when presented to Banh the man claims it was still alive when he was pulling it out.

While it is a great relief that the man’s intestines weren’t hanging out but the idea of a worm inside our bodies definitely is enough to make my skin crawl. Now when it came to trying to determine where the man obtained his intestinal friend they determined that it was from eating this raw fish apparently one too many times. That being said, Bahn also mentioned there was a warning about parasites in salmon not too long ago sent out by the CDC.

Now, if anyone is not familiar with tapeworms, they are long flat-worms that consist of segments. They live in our intestines when we have them and they can cause a lot of issues. Click here to learn more about tapeworms in general.

And you don’t need to be a medical specialist to see that there is something really, really, really wrong with Trump. There’s...

His consistent lying about the size of things.

His inability to sit still and pay attention for any length of time.

His lack of empathy for anyone who is not rich and white.

His stunningly awful picks for government posts — people who are determined to cripple if not destroy the very departments they are chosen to lead.

His constant need for approval and the temper tantrums that follow any criticism.

He’s never alone; there is always a crowd of people surrounding him, mostly his family members, to make sure he stays somewhat on track, and to step in when he veers off into nonsense.

Those of you who say “Give him a chance; he’s only been at the job a week”, you are just deluding yourself. The longer he stays in office the more harm he can do. Look at the declarations he’s already signed:

Cutting off funds to all programs that incidentally might counsel abortion.

Restarting the pipeline projects.

Calling Jan. 20, 2017 retroactively a national day of patriotism or something. (Really?)

Beginning to dismantle Obamacare.

Who’s creating these declarations anyway? And handing them for him to sign?

He’s not going to fulfill most of his campaign promises. You know, the ones he got the crowds at his rallies so worked up about.

“Draining the swamp” — he’s filled it with more swamp dwellers, people who really don’t care about the good of the country, only lining their own pockets..

“Lock her up” — he’s now said he won’t pursue that. And the case is without merit.

“More jobs” — dismantling Obamacare will cost thousands of jobs; the pipeline project will create a few hundred jobs here in the US for a short time, but many more jobs for the Canadian tar sands workers.

“Better trade deals” — this is going to start trade wars with the rest of the world and prices for goods will soar for everyone.

“Health care for everyone” — the Rebublican dominated Congress won’t go along with that. People will die from lack of affordable medical care.

“Build a wall” — there will be no wall that Mexico pays for. If constructed, the wall will cost American tax dollars.

An implausible accusation refuses to die.

By Jim Geraghty — December 15, 2016

If, as reports suggest, President-elect Trump will nominate Carly Fiorina to be the next director of national intelligence, some Democratic senators contemplating her confirmation may feel tempted to claim that she leaked classified information in one of the Republican presidential debates. But they would be foolish decision to repeat that baseless charge, which is still rocketing around liberal blogs.

The dubious accusation stems from Fiorina’s statement in a November 2015 debate on Fox News that “We have more IRS agents than we have FBI and CIA. Does that strike you as a misallocation of resources? Of course it is.”

The Daily Beast’s Olivia Nuzzi jumped on the statement, claiming Fiorina is guilty of “either lying or dangerously close to revealing classified information.”

Nuzzi pointed out that the precise number of CIA agents is classified — and that because public records indicate the number of IRS agents and FBI agents, anyone who can do math could calculate the remainder. In 2006, Fiorina headed up a CIA External Advisory Board, and regularly lunched privately with then-director Michael Hayden. Nuzzi then leveled a heavy charge with a lot of caveats:

If Fiorina did in fact learn how many officers the CIA employs through her relationship with Hayden or her work on the board, she surely learned, too, that the information was not for public consumption — meaning that she knowingly gave a ballpark estimate for a classified data point on national television.

A nefarious scenario, one that ignores the fact that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a budget that breaks down the total number of personnel and positions at each agency, which the Washington Post published in 2013. The newspaper’s report featured elaborate charts and graphs about the number of employees in the intelligence community, as well as the budgets and mission objectives of those agencies. (A Fiorina aide confirms to National Review that her campaign staff found the estimated figure using Google and checking with outside experts.)

The accusation against Fiorina didn’t arrive in a vacuum. Since the revelation that Hillary Clinton never used a government e-mail account and all of her e-mails were kept on a private server, including messages that held classified information, voices on the left have contended that almost everyone with a security clearance spills state secrets from time to time. Around the same time, Newsweek suggested that Ted Cruz also leaked classified information in a Republican debate, when he said, while discussing domestic-surveillance programs, “the old program covered 20 percent to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists. The new program covers nearly 100 percent.” This too represented a discussion of publicly reported information. Cruz spokeswoman Katherine Frazier pointed out that those numbers were reported by the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal a year earlier.

Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, pointed out that repeating facts that have already been reported to the public does not constitute leaking classified information. (If that were the case, every journalist covering the alleged leaks would be committing a crime as well.)

Fiorina may be an unexpected choice for the next Director of National Intelligence, and her record, both on the CIA advisory board and in corporate life, will undoubtedly be examined closely by the Senate Intelligence Committee in the confirmation process. But no one should waste time on a ginned-up controversy over her long-forgotten debate comment.

The differences in income growth, using these two measures, are clear. The D.C. area has gotten fatter, especially the richest counties.

In addition to the public relations and lobbying boom Glenn mentions as one factor influencing the region’s wealth, total federal spending is likely another influencing factor. Income growth rates in the richest D.C.-area counties (and Washington itself) are approximately twice those for the rest of the country; the D.C.-area growth rates are 10% higher than the richest non-D.C.-area counties.

The percentage of total federal government spending growth for 2000 to 2010 corresponds closely to the percentage growth in median incomes in the D.C. area’s richest counties compared to the rest of the United States: it also approximately doubles, from around $$1.8 trillion in 2000 to around $$3.5 trillion in 2010. Total federal spending is certainly not the only indicator of income growth in the Washington region, but there appears to be a relationship.

What about “kill them wherever you find them” (Quran 2:191, 4:89, and 9:5)? What about “strike terror into the hearts of the enemies of Allah” (Quran 8:60)?

But I commend Sam Newhouse for including my remarks without the usual nasty editorializing that accompanies quotes from me in mainstream media outlets.

“Kenney under fire from conservatives after Islam comments,” by Sam Newhouse, Metro.us, January 12, 2016:

In his first week in office, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney dealt with every mayor’s worst nightmare — a cop being shot.

In his second week, Kenney has become a national punching bag — at least, in conservative media outlets — for his widely reported comments that the actions of shooter Edward Archer, who said he was inspired by ISIS to attempt to kill officer Jesse Hartnett, had nothing to do with Islam.

“In no way shape or form does anyone in this room believe that Islam or the teaching of Islam has anything to do with what you’ve seen on the screen,” Kenney told media at a press conference Friday. “It is terrible and it does not represent the religion or any of its teachings. This is a criminal with a stolen gun who tried to kill one of our officers.”

But Police Commissioner Richard Ross had apparently contradicted those statements moments earlier when he said Archer told police he attacked Hartnett out of loyalty to ISIS and because police officers were violating the laws of Islam. Police and the FBI continue to investigate an unverified tip that Archer was a member of a group with three other members who still pose a risk to police.

Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pounced on Kenney’s comments at a campaign stop Saturday, calling him “delusional” and bashing Democrats in general for avoiding using the phrase “radical Islamic terrorist.”

“The mayor of Philadelphia — who I know nothing about other than the fact that he’s delusional — said this has nothing to do with ISIS or Islam; this is because there are too many guns in the street,” Rubio said, according to CNN.

Kenney responded to Rubio in a statement, “I stand by what I said: this criminal is not representative of Islam. Period. I think candidates for office, particularly for president, should not demonize an entire group of Americans because of the actions of violent criminals with deranged views of Islam. … Show some class and dignity when you are running for the highest office in the land.”

Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt indicated via email that Kenney is done defending his comments.

“We haven’t released any ‘clarifying’ statements because what the mayor said doesn’t need to be clarified,” Hitt wrote.

“The acts of this criminal, regardless of whether or not the FBI finds that he was connected to a larger terrorist group, have nothing to do with Islam. There is nothing in the Quran that promotes terrorism or violent acts of this nature. This deplorable excuse for a human being and any others who invoke Allah to explain their violent actions have a deranged, inaccurate understanding of Islam,” she continued.

“It was Mayor Kenney’s most basic responsibility to stand up at Friday’s press conference and both praise the extremely heroic actions of this offer and also remind all Philadelphians that, regardless of what this criminal said, he is not representative of Islam. We cannot scapegoat the 25 percent of Philadelphians who practice Islam because of this criminal’s horrific actions and even more disgusting explanation of why he did it. They are our neighbors.”

But in the meantime, more and more conservative pundits are lining up to take swings at Kenney, and show no signs of slowing down.

He was bashed by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who called him a “Looney Tune mayor” and an “idiot.” His words are also the subject of a critical Wall Street Journal column published Tuesday.

“The mayor’s comments, so bizarre in their determined denial of the deluge of facts delivered by top police officials standing next to him, were, nonetheless, familiar enough,” columnist Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote. “Americans have learned to expect, after every Islamist terror attack, lectures instructing them that such assaults should in no way be connected to Islamic faith of any kind.”

Kenney’s comments seem to have touched a nerve — particularly with right-leaning media, where a common theme is the alleged concealment by liberal leaders and mainstream media of crimes committed by Muslims.

Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative and leader of Stop Islamization of America, said of Kenney’s argument that the Muslim faith and the actions of Archer were separate, “That distinction is not possible. If Islamic texts and teachings inspired him, how could Islam not be responsible?”

“Kenney, like virtually every other public official these days, seems to think it’s his duty to cover for Islam and make sure no one thinks ill of it, no matter how high the stack of bodies of jihad victims gets,” Geller said via email. “Kenney may not be stopping police from releasing details related to Islam about the case, but he is seriously derelict in his duty in not investigating what is being taught at Archer’s mosque, and closing it down if it is found to be encouraging violence and sedition.”

The attacks have become sufficiently widespread that they drew a defense Tuesday morning from City Council President Darrell Clarke, who denounced the criticism as “hateful comments.”

“As good neighbors and citizens, Philadelphia’s Muslim leaders were quick to condemn the violent assault on Officer Hartnett,” Clarke said in a statement. “Mayor Kenney’s call for tolerance following last week’s hateful act is perfectly appropriate.”

He continued, “If Edward Archer’s claims are true, he would join a growing line of hateful outliers who seek to justify their violent acts through a perverted interpretation of Islam. While law enforcement officials continue to investigate this incident, we should act responsibly and refrain from jumping to conclusions, and instead direct our energy toward wishing Officer Jesse Hartnett a speedy and complete recovery.”

In an editorial, the South Jersey Times took the middle ground — defending Kenney’s comments, but criticizing him for dismissing Archer’s own declarations of ties to Islam.

“It’s one thing — and the right thing — for Kenney to say that the great majority of Philadelphia-area Muslims have condemned the attack on the officer and can’t find a single place in the Koran that justifies it,” the editorial said.

“But to classify the incident as a lone-wolf act of a street criminal marginalizes the real possibility that a loose confederation of ISIS followers are actively trying to kill city cops. However small the group is, and however warped its interpretation of the Muslim faith might be, violent acts in the name of those warped values are, indeed, terrorism.”",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Philly mayor under fire for covering for Islam after jihad shooting of cop,"Pamela Geller, ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Deplorable, Mahou Shoujo, No Quarter, Fred Sawyer, Screw Socialism, El Cid, Rua Richard Cranium, Ben Hur, Shafiq Islam",,[''],,,,

Jen Doll is Emily Post’s worst nightmare.

Doll, who as a journalist for The Village Voice and elsewhere has written about the pride and predilections of a privileged class of unmarried women in New York City, has published her first book, a memoir about weddings she has attended. It’s called “Save the Date: The Occasional Mortifications of a Serial Wedding Guest,” and its wedding-cakey cover ­conceals a secret. It’s not about marriage at all, but rather its inverse.

“To a single woman,” Doll writes, “a lifetime of weddings can begin to seem like a nuptial-themed ‘Groundhog Day.’ ” Each chapter, save the introduction, centers on one wedding — the first that Doll remembers attending as a child, the one at which she didn’t catch the bouquet that landed at her feet, the same-sex union she covered as a reporter — but uses it to tell the tale of Doll herself, an intermittently employed, intensely cathected friend and unstable girlfriend who has been to more than 20 ceremonies yet has never been a bride herself.

“While one might assume a wedding is about . . . the couple getting married,” Doll writes in a meta-reflection on her book’s subject, it is actually “about everyone. . . . We are still whoever we are, beings comprising our past histories as well as our desired futures, when we show up to celebrate.”

Doll is making a sly side entrance to a powerful point: While we’re still sold scads of pinkly bound books that end in promises to honor and cherish, women’s lives these days do not always follow the cradle-to-altar path laid out by Shakespeare and Disney, and alternatives to wifeliness are not limited to penury or laudanum overdose. Doll herself is a funny, bright, complicated leading lady whose own pursuit of romance is something of a sideline. Boyfriends appear and disappear, but her heart is not in these couplings. It’s friends, work, drink and the pursuit of good stories that drive her, often to excess. In the course of the book, she falls out with a friend over a husband she doesn’t like, throws up and throws shoes, and confesses that she considered calling a chapter “Jen Might Have Had Sort of a Drinking Problem for a While.”

Still, the nuptial structure of “Save the Date” has its costs, prompting Doll to repeat the sin of the industry itself: making weddings mean more than they should. At times, she strains to persuade readers that these silly parties are actually crucibles in which relationships are forged or founder. “Each wedding we attend, in whatever role we uphold,” she writes with the effort of overstatement, “will highlight some aspect of our own lives, reflecting and reframing the way in which we look at ourselves.”

Also problematic is the social pit Doll digs herself by writing of her friends’ marriages. Weddings badly need someone to be mean about them. Doll lets some acid drip gratifyingly onto her book’s opening pages — “Congratulations! Or is it best ­wishes? Here is your KitchenAid. Le Creuset Dutch oven. Kate Spade stemware” — but as she writes about specific couplings, she goes ­toothless, describing wet eyes and radiant brides with elegant buns. It’s easy to understand this urge to put a generous gloss on her friends’ events. After all, Doll has drunk their midshelf bourbon and danced to their bluegrass bands. What’s more, her singleness — the radical heart of her story — leaves her open to charges of jealous resentment. But her vanilla kindnesses undermine her otherwise sharp observations about her own aversions to marital expectation.",2018-02-11 00:47:31.142466,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Altar Ego,Rebecca Traister,,"['Save the Date: The Occasional Mortifications of a Serial Wedding Guest (Book)', 'Books and Literature', 'Doll  Jen', 'Save the Date (Book)']",Jen Doll’s first book is a memoir about weddings she has attended.,,,nytimes

Despite a disorganized campaign rife with Russian-affiliated individuals and criminals, Trump has stood firm on this issue.

Now, it appears the tune may be changing. At a press conference today, Sarah Sanders let slip that it’s possible people in the campaign—but not Trump—colluded with Russia.

In a tense exchange with Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Sarah Sanders was asked what “collusion” means to the Trump administration, and then whether Trump speaks for himself or everyone on the campaign.

Maggie opened her line of questioning with, “The president has said repeatedly there there was no collusion between the campaign and Russia. Do you define what he means when he says ‘collusion?’ Is he talking about meetings between officials? Is he talking about information exchanging hands? What does that mean?”

To which Sarah Sanders responded:

‘I think the accusation against the president is that he had help winning the election and that’s simply untrue. The president won because he was the better candidate, because he worked harder, because he had a message that America actually cared about and believed in, and came out in a historic fashion and supported and voted for him. ‘That’s why he won. It wasn’t because of some made-up hoax that has been created to delegitimize this president. It’s because he was the best candidate at the right time that America wanted to see, and that’s why he’s in the Oval Office today.’

It’s hard to know where to start with that pile of drivel. First, “America” voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote by what was truly a historic amount. The only thing “historic” about Donald Trump’s victory was losing the popular vote by a greater margin than every other “winning” president who lost it combined—and then multiplied by two. There has never been a “winner” who loses like Trump.

The next question Sanders faced was, “Does he think the reporting from the intelligence community saying that there was hacking that went on, done by Russia, he rejects that?”

‘No. He’s addressed that, but that doesn’t mean that he participated in it. I think those are very different things. Stating the existence of something happening is very different than having helped make it happen. And you can’t conflate the two, and I think oftentimes that’s what individuals are trying to do.’

It’s notable here that her statement directly contradicts the first thing she said, which was that Trump didn’t have help. Now she’s acknowledging that the Russians helped Trump, but stating that he didn’t cooperate with them or communicate with them or have anything to do with it. Of course, that doesn’t explain the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting, multiple meetings with the Russian ambassador that Trump’s flunkies repeatedly lied about, or Trump’s shady money connections with Russia. It doesn’t explain why Trump publicly called for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, and it doesn’t explain why he refused to enact sanctions even after signing a bill (passed by a veto-proof majority) that made it law.

It also doesn’t explain why Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that he believes Putin over the intelligence community, except when under great pressure.

Finally, she was asked the coup de grace: “Does he mean that about himself, or about campaign officials?”

‘Look, I think he’s stating for himself and to anything that he would be a part of or know about, or have sanctioned.’

This reads as “yeah, people may have colluded, but Trump himself had nothing to do with it.”

Every week, the story changes. It remains to be seen what the truth is, but one thing is for sure: It isn’t the Trump administration’s ever-evolving story.

(Before It's News)

The real lessons of Greece:

Greece’s Economy Is a Lesson for Republicans in the U.S., by Paul Krugman, Commentary, NY Times: …Greece has … played an outsized role in U.S. political debate, as a symbol of the terrible things that will supposedly happen — any day now — unless we stop helping the less fortunate and printing money to fight unemployment. And Greece does indeed offer important lessons to the rest of us. But they’re not the lessons you think…

To understand the real lessons of Greece, you need to be aware of two crucial points.

The first is that the “We’re Greece!” crowd has a truly remarkable track record when it comes to economic forecasting: They’ve been wrong about everything, year after year, but refuse to learn from their mistakes. …

The second is that the story you’ve heard about Greece — that it borrowed too much, and its excessive debt led to the current crisis — is seriously incomplete. Greece did indeed run up too much debt (with a lot of help from irresponsible lenders). But its debt, while high, wasn’t that high by historical standards. What turned Greek debt troubles into catastrophe was Greece’s inability, thanks to the euro, to do what countries with large debts usually do: impose fiscal austerity, yes, but offset it with easy money. …The result was an economic implosion that ended up making the debt problem even worse. Greece’s formula for disaster, in other words, didn’t just involve austerity; it involved the toxic combination of austerity with hard money.

So who wants to impose that kind of toxic policy mix on America? The answer is, most of the Republican Party.

On one side, just about everyone in the G.O.P. demands that we reduce government spending, especially aid to lower-income families. (They also, of course, want to reduce taxes on the rich — but that wouldn’t do much to boost demand for U.S. products.)

On the other side, leading Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan incessantly attack the Federal Reserve for its efforts to boost the economy, delivering solemn lectures on the evils of “debasing” the dollar… Oh, and many Republicans hanker for a return to the gold standard, which would effectively put us into a euro-like straitjacket.

The point is that if you really worry that the U.S. might turn into Greece, you should focus your concern on America’s right. Because if the right gets its way on economic policy — slashing spending while blocking any offsetting monetary easing — it will, in effect, bring the policies behind the Greek disaster to America.

“Iraqi forces were able to defeat an assault by the Islamic State in the area of Jarais in northern Ramadi, destroying four car bombs rigged with heavy explosives,” said the Iraqi army’s Brig Gen. Ismail Mahlawi.

Meanwhile, a Rudaw reporter in Ramadi added that warplanes from the US-led coalition had bombed two improvised car bombs in the area of Taamim in southwestern Ramadi.

The politics.co.uk poll, which comes as government ministers from across the world meet in Vienna for the UN’s summit on drugs, shows a deep split in public opinion over how to proceed with narcotics legislation.

Asked if drugs should be legalised, just under 50 per cent of respondents answered ‘yes’, while 37 per cent said ‘no’.

But opinions on the reclassification of cannabis were far clearer.

Thirteen per cent of users agreed with the decision, compared with 87 per cent who said they ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’.

The government recently implemented the change to cannabis, bringing it back up to class B after former home secretary David Blunkett expended considerable political capital downgrading it to class C in 2003.

But the poll showed considerably less sympathy towards calls from the government’s own Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to downgrade ecstasy.

Over 50 per cent of users said they disagreed with the decision, while 37 per cent agreed.

Ahead of his much anticipated address at the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York, Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down with American talk show host and journalist Charlie Rose to share his opinion on the today’s hottest news topics.

Putin on Ukraine: ‘It is absolutely unacceptable to address issues, including controversial ones, as well as domestic issues of the former Soviet Republics through the so-called color revolutions, through coups and unconstitutional means of toppling the current government’.

Of course, Russia’s closest neighbor, Ukraine, is part of the daily news agenda.

President Putin cast some light on why the Ukraine issue is such a huge problem for Russia.

“Ukraine is the closest country to us. We have always said that Ukraine is our sister country and it is true. It is not just a Slavic people, it is the closest people to Russia: we have similar languages, culture, common history, religion etc.”

He also revealed what he believes is completely unacceptable for Russia.

“Addressing issues, including controversial ones, as well as domestic issues of the former Soviet Republics through the so-called colored revolutions, through coups and unconstitutional means of toppling the current government. That is absolutely unacceptable. Our partners in the United States are not trying to hide the fact that they supported those opposed to President Yanukovych.”

Asked whether he believed the United States had something to do with the ousting of Yanukovych, causing him to flee to Russia, the president replied that he, in fact, knew this for sure, at the same time describing his sources.

“It is very simple. We have thousands of contacts and thousands of connections with people who live in Ukraine. And we know who had meetings and worked with people who overthrew Viktor Yanukovych, as well as when and where they did it.”

“We know the ways the assistance was provided, we know how much they paid them, we know which territories and countries hosted training and how it was done, we know who the instructors were.”

“We know everything. Well, actually, our US partners are not keeping it a secret.”

Putin on the sovereignty of Ukraine: ‘At no time in the past, now or in the future has or will Russia take any part in actions aimed at overthrowing the legitimate government.’

The Russian leader also stressed that Russia respects the sovereignty of Ukraine and Russia had not and would not take any part in any activities aimed at overthrowing the legitimate government of any country. He added that Russia would never resort to the use of the military force in such a case.

However, the president called on other countries to respect the sovereignty of other states, including Ukraine.

“Respecting the sovereignty means preventing coups, unconstitutional actions and illegitimate overthrowing of the legitimate government.”

Putin on Russia’s military presence in Ukraine: ‘If we keep our troops on our territory on the border with some state, it is not a crime.’

The issue of Russia’s military presence in Ukraine has long had the Western media in a flurry. But the Russian president explained it using the example of the US' military presence in Europe.

CBSNews Vladimir Putin gives interview to CBS channel

“US tactical nuclear weapons are in Europe, let us not forget this. Does it mean that the US has occupied Germany or that the US never stopped the occupation after World War II and only transformed the occupation troops into NATO forces?”

“And if we keep our troops on our territory on the border with some state, you see it is a crime?”

Putin on his rating and popularity: ‘There is something that unites me and other citizens of Russia. It is love for our Motherland.’

The sufferings and hardships of the Second World War remain the unifying factor of the Russian nation.

“Yes, my family and my relatives as a whole suffered heavy losses during the Second World War. That is true. In my father's family there were five brothers and four of them were killed, I believe. On my mother's side the situation is much the same.”

“In general, Russia suffered heavily. No doubt, we cannot forget that and we must not forget, not to accuse anyone but to ensure that nothing of the kind ever happens again.”

Putin on democracy: ‘There can be no democracy without observing the law and everyone must observe it – that is the most basic and important thing that we all should remember.’

The president explained that the most important thing in the country’s domestic policy is to continue improving the political system so that every citizen feels that they can influence the life of the state and society, they can influence the authorities, and so that the authorities will be aware of their responsibility before those people who gave their confidence to the representatives of the authorities in the elections.

As for those tragic incidents where lives are lost, including those of journalists, unfortunately, it happens in all countries around the world, he said.

But if it occurs in Russia, the president stressed, the authorities take every step possible to ensure that the perpetrators are found, identified and punished.

There were a number of questions that made the president smile and answer light-heartedly.

Putin on the disintegration of the Soviet Union and recreation of the Soviet empire: ‘The Russians have turned out to be the largest divided nation in the world nowadays.

The host's question on the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the possible recreation of a sphere of influence, which President Putin might think Russia deserves, made him smile.

“Your questions make me happy,” he responded. “Somebody is always suspecting Russia of having some ambitions, there are always those who are trying to misinterpret us or keep something back.”

“I did say that I see the collapse of the Soviet Union as a great tragedy of the 20th century. Do you know why? First of all, because 25 million Russian people suddenly turned out to be outside the borders of the Russian Federation.”

“They used to live in one state; the Soviet Union has traditionally been called Russia, the Soviet Russia, and it was the great Russia. They used to live in one country and suddenly found themselves abroad. Can you imagine how many problems came about?”

“First, there were everyday issues, the separation of families, economic and social problems. The list is endless.”

“Do you think it is normal that 25 million people, Russian people, suddenly found themselves abroad?”

“The Russians have turned out to be the largest divided nation in the world nowadays. Is that not a problem? It is not a problem for you as it is for me.”

And then there were some personal questions, such as how he feels being called a czar.

The president light-heartedly answered that the title does not fit him, though he is used to being called many different things. In fact, it does not matter to him what people call him.

He also talked about his past as an intelligence officer, admitting that every stage of one’s life has an impact on the person.

“Whatever we do, all the knowledge, the experience, it stays with us, we carry it, use it in one way or another. In this sense, yes, you are right — there is no such thing as a former KGB man. Once a KGB man, always a KGB man.”

But then laughed while answering the host's question:

“Once, somebody from the CIA told me that the training you have is important, that you learn to be liked as well. Because you have to charm people, you have to seduce them,” Charlie Rose said.

“Well, if the CIA told you so, then it must be true. They are experts on that,” laughed the president.

President Putin refused to assess the President of the United States, saying he is not entitled to do that. This is up to the American people.

Finally he revealed what is most important to him.

“What is important is what you think you must do in the interests of the country, which put you in such position, such a position as the Head of the Russian State.”",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,60 Minutes of Putin: There Can Be No Democracy Without Observing the Law,,,"['address', 'color revolutions', 'military presence', 'popularity', 'interview', 'rating', 'sovereignty', '70th UN General Assembly', 'PBS', 'CBS News', 'Charlie Rose', 'Vladimir Putin', 'United States', 'Ukraine', 'Russia']","His love and pride for Russia, his pain over what is going on in Ukraine, his past as an intelligence officer and his attitude towards being called a czar – these are some of the issues brought up in Russian President Vladimir Putin's interview with American talk show host and journalist Charlie Rose.","PBS, popularity, Ukraine, color revolutions, Russia, military presence, Charlie Rose, sovereignty, Vladimir Putin, address, rating, 70th UN General Assembly, United States, CBS News, interview",,
3502,9782843.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/world/americas/galapagos-islands-ecuador-environment.html,"The stakes are high. “A lot could be lost, and a lot could be saved,” said Tui De Roy, a photographer and environmentalist who grew up in the Galápagos and has been publishing pictures of the islands for decades. “Which way it goes,” Ms. De Roy said, “depends on human behavior.”

As Ms. Berdonces takes charge, the Ecuadorean government is taking steps to better protect the Galápagos. It is banning all fishing in the northern third of the island chain and creating a sanctuary for sharks. A new port on the mainland will be the exclusive conduit for cargo bound for the islands, the better to keep nonnative animals and plants from reaching the islands and disturbing the ecological balance. The government has also imposed a 36-room limit on new hotels to limit crowds, and is bringing together the management of land and sea areas, which had been overseen separately.

“We need both working together,” Ms. Berdonces said. “Before, when a sea lion was on the rocks, it was under the supervision of the park. When it went into the water, it was the responsibility of the marine reserve.”

One problem facing Ms. Berdonces is the long-running tension over the rising numbers of tourists visiting the Galápagos and concerns about the harm they may do. The islands were designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1979, and the United Nations agency declared in 2007 that they were in danger, partly because of what it called unbridled tourism.

The annual number of visitors had been growing steadily — to 145,000 in 2006, the year before the agency acted, from just 40,000 in 1990, according to the Galápagos Conservancy, an environmental organization in Fairfax, Va. Unesco took the islands off the endangered list in 2010, saying they were making progress, but tourism continued to grow; the Ecuadorean government reported that 224,755 tourists landed on the islands in 2015.

The Galápagos have long had few human inhabitants. But the magnet of employment in the tourism industry has drawn about 30,000 people, mostly from mainland Ecuador, to seek their fortunes here. They work in restaurants and hotels and on island-hopping cruise ships; they teach surfing, rent bicycles, lead tours and sell sundries.

Two-thirds of them live in the main town, Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz. The main street is a narrow brick-paved road, called Avenue Charles Darwin, that curves along glistening Academy Bay, lined with businesses like Natural Selection Tours, Tortoise Jewelry, and the Pelican View Restaurant and Bar.

Ms. Berdonces’ father, Vicente, 58, has run a scuba diving company on Santa Cruz Island for more than 20 years. Her connection to tourism may raise concerns among some environmentalists, but she has strong local support.

Susana Schiess, a Swiss immigrant who runs one of the most successful restaurants on Santa Cruz, flashed two thumbs up at news of Ms. Berdonces’ appointment.

“She knows the islands,” Ms. Schiess said. “She knows the problems. She’s very young, and that could be a problem. But I think she’ll do her best.”

Talking about his daughter’s first name, Mr. Berdonces said he and his wife had expected that, like them, she would have a strong personality. And they wanted something distinctive. Somehow the name Africa popped up.

“That was it,” he said. “That was the only name for her.”

His daughter is focused and disciplined, he said. “She organizes the family and her friends.”

He added, “And we always have to say ‘yes,’ because she’s right.”

Dr. Gabriel Idrovo, a physician, national park guide and dive master, has known Ms. Berdonces since she was a teenager. “She’s straightforward and trustworthy,” he said.

The islands became Ecuador’s first national park in 1959, and the administration of the park developed slowly. The first director was not named until 1971, and some directors since then have had short tenures: In one three-year period, the post changed hands 14 times.

“It’s an important job,” Dr. Idrovo said. “But I wouldn’t want to be in her boots. It’s a hard job. It’s a tough balancing act.”",2018-02-11 00:48:56.165225,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Galápagos Islands Gain a New Guardian as Ecuador Moves to Protect the Park,Joseph B.

But another client — a longtime customer, Mr. Neal said — was in arrears for $45,000, ignored all five letters and then went out of business in late October. “It will have to be written off,” he said.

That is painful for a low-margin industry like his, which typically bills within 15 days and in which 95 percent of clients pay promptly, Mr. Neal said. His firm typically has $4.5 million a week in receivables, he said, and payments started slowing in November 2008.

Geoffrey Wilson, owner of 352 Media, a 10-year-old Web development firm in Gainesville, Fla., lost $165,000 in early 2008 when three clients did not pay. The three firms were start-ups, he said, two in Florida, one in Michigan.

“It was devastating,” he said. “It damaged our cash flow and really hurt us.” The company, with major companies like Microsoft and American Express, did not have to lay off any of its 40 employees, but the experience left scars, Mr. Wilson said.

“It makes you really angry,” he said. “These were clients we had extensive interactions with over several months, sometimes with as many as 50 meetings. It felt very personal. Suddenly you have to threaten them, sue them.”

Today, Mr. Wilson is much more cautious about accepting new clients and is clear from the outset about payment terms — 33 percent upfront, raised from 25 percent in August 2008. Clients are now classified as standard or preferred, the latter being firms with 15 employees and at least two years in business. Standard clients must pay in full before material is delivered, and the business owner will be asked for a personal guarantee, he said.

Some customers are newly candid about their own financial woes, “which we’d never seen before,” he said. “They’ve become very truthful. As a business owner, I really appreciate their honesty. It allows us to better plan our situation. I need an accurate understanding of what’s coming in instead of having a client simply go silent.”

Lisa Brock, head of Brock Communications in Tampa, Fla., is taking a personal approach to managing late payers, recently visiting the chief executives of two local clients to negotiate payment. Now, more than ever, Ms. Brock said, she wants to know whom she is dealing with before entering into any business deal. A free consultation allows her to decide if a client’s values match hers. If so, she delves deeply into their references. “We’ve done more of this recently than in the 14 years we’ve been in business,” she said. “There are a number of ways to check people out: annual reports, a Dun & Bradstreet report, ask for personal and professional references.”

Cindy White, whose 11-year-old company manufactures knitted ribbon jackets that are sold in 40 high-end boutiques nationwide for $800 to $1,000, has been owed $5,000 for six months from several clients, forcing her to lay off employees. She has also fallen behind in the rent on her Phoenix design studio. “I have a lot of stores out there who owe me money, but they’re my bread and butter. You don’t want to upset them by suing or sending out collection letters.”

The decision whether to hold back or escalate demands for payment was made for her recently after a seven-year client, a store that closed, refused to communicate with her and did not pay for the jackets she had shipped. “I was furious,” Ms. White said. “This was a store I had a longstanding relationship with.”

Ever since, she said, “I have been on the phone every few days with all the stores that owe me money, just keeping tabs and making sure they are still viable.” She said she is hopeful that the economy will come back, and “I am willing to work with them because they are my lifeblood.”

Such attentiveness is necessary, agreed Ms. Brock. “I look at our profit and loss statements biweekly.” She advises scrutinizing client lists to predict potential trouble spots. “Even having two slow payers is significant.”

When a client refuses to pay, last-ditch options include hiring a collections agency — which typically recoup in full only 11 percent of the time — hiring a collections lawyer, who may claim one-third of what they recover, or filing a case in small-claims court. Joshua Friedman, a collections lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif., said his business had been booming since last fall, with clients coming to him “in every field you can imagine.”

“Sometimes people can’t pay. Sometimes it’s a matter of straight-out fraud, where buyers are not doing enough due diligence. People are desperate to do the deal,” he said. Mr. Friedman takes on only cases worth more than $10,000.

“I try to resolve everything without filing a suit,” he said. His success rate is still only 20 percent, he warned. “My clients know better than I do if the client is really likely to settle.”",2018-02-11 00:43:59.096179,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,When Good Customers Become Bad Bill Payers,Caitlin Kelly,,"['Small Business', 'Recession and Depression', 'National Federation of Independent Business']",The recession has taught many entrepreneurs to take action before customers get deeply into arrears.,,,nytimes

He states that if they can't confirm a source or have additional sources that confirm the story they don't report it. It's basic Journalism professional ethics. Sometimes after stories are announced, the media may realize they got it wrong and they retract and publically apologize.As in regular criminal cases, you can't declare someone is guilty until you have enough evidence or ""circumstantial"" evidence that points in the direction that a person is guilty. The same goes for reporters. If they get enough credible sources and they all check out to that person being at the right place at the right time, and other persons close to the source are saying the same thing, than that is strong enough evidence that the information is credible.There was a lot of circumstantial evidence whether Nixon was directly involved in Watergate. The media back than reported on the possible guilt of Nixon. If it wasn't for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, Nixon would have never been exposed as being involved. It turned out they were exactly right!Journalists can sometimes get it wrong, just like our court systems. It doesn't justify claiming everything they report is fake news just because they go against someone's support of a president or an elected official.

In these comments, I can only provide a few hints as to how I think the subject can be productively explored, keeping to the United States for several reasons. First, the U.S. is unmatched in its global significance and impact. Second, it is an unusually open society, possibly uniquely so, which means we know more about it. Finally, it is plainly the most important case for Americans, who are able to influence policy choices in the U.S. — and indeed for others, insofar as their actions can influence such choices. The general principles, however, extend to the other major powers, and well beyond. There is a “received standard version,” common to academic scholarship, government pronouncements, and public discourse. It holds that the prime commitment of governments is to ensure security, and that the primary concern of the U.S. and its allies since 1945 was the Russian threat.

There are currently just over 16.8 million tokens in circulation and bitcoin opened on the markets at £9,887.28 ($13,619.03) today, according to CoinDesk. Written directly into the bitcoin protocol, there is a 21 million limit on how many tokens can ever exist at any one point in time. But CommerceBlock CEO Nicholas Gregory has said that when the limit is reached then the transaction costs and fees will be enough to keep the bitcoin network running.

In December he told Express.co.uk: “I’m not sure of an exact date, but essentially when the cap comes to an end it should be the transaction fees that will still keep the miners from mining and at the moment the fees are quite high anyway. “I think bitcoin miners earn a large percentage of the money from the fees anyway, so it’s not rally seen as a problem.” When Satoshi Nakamoto introduced bitcoin to the world in 2009, the goal of the capped supply was to limit the effects of inflation. All current predictions suggest that miners are still decades away from reaching the cap, while the effort needed to successfully mine new bitcoin is getting harder by the day.

GETTY The bitcoin mining process is becoming increasingly harder every time a block is broken down

Long-term forecasts suggest that the bitcoin deadline will not be reached until May 2140. Each bitcoin is mined from what is known as a block – a data set on the blockchain – which releases a handful of tokens each time it is successful broken down.

A great majority of bitcoiners believe digital scarcity will make bitcoin more valuable over time, and with 16.8 million mined so far it will get harder Jamie Redman, Bitcoin.com

But the computer algorithms behind the blocks are getting harder to crack. It is a feature of the system that encouraged early adoption and now fights off inflation. The current block reward is 12.5 bitcoin, but approximately avery 210,000 blocks the reward is cut in half. This will happen sometime in 2020. The original mining reward stood at 50 tokens before it was halved to 25 and then 12.5. The next reward will only account for 6.25 tokens per block, thus making mining unprofitable.

The increasing difficulty is further evident considering how 70 percent of all bitcoin were already mined by 2017, but between 2016 and 2017 only 7 percent were released. Then from 2017 to 2018 only another 3 percent were mined, and next year this is expected to be lower. Some experts have suggested that once the number of available tokens decreases, bitcoin’s price tag could go through the roof. Jamie Redman, contributor to Bitcoin.com, said: “In most cases when an asset is limited and resources are harder to come by, the supply causes demand for the market. “The supply of bitcoin shows a significant gap between how many there are and those who want to obtain some.

“A great majority of bitcoiners believe digital scarcity will make bitcoin more valuable over time, and with 16.8 million mined so far it will get harder.” However, Mr Gregory said that there could still be millions of tokens out that are left unaccounted for. He said: “There’s quite a lot that have been lost. “Those mining bitcoin in the early days didn’t realise the stakes I think and then there’s the question of the people who invented bitcoin – known as Satoshi Nakamoto.",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Bitcoin price: 80% of cryptocurrency mined - What will happen to BTC next?,"Sebastian Kettley, Jamie Redman",,[''],BITCOIN miners reached a major milestone over the weekend because more than 80 per cent of the cryptocurrency has now been mined into circulation.

Hinchey, a Democrat not seeking re-election, and split its territory among several surrounding districts. It also carved up the district in Brooklyn and Queens represented by Bob Turner, a Republican who won an upset victory in the special election last fall for the unexpired term of Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat. Mr. Turner is now seeking the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat.

The plan is largely the same as that proposed by the magistrate judge, Roanne L. Mann.

Judge Mann produced her map with assistance from a redistricting expert at Columbia Law School, Nathaniel Persily. They did not take into account the residences of incumbent lawmakers, and their proposal drew praise from government watchdog groups for its compact, common-sense districts.

The lawyers who brought a lawsuit on behalf of a group of civic leaders and urged the federal courts to take over the process praised the judges’ order.

“Through this well-reasoned decision, the court has adeptly responded to the exigent circumstances caused by the Legislature’s failure to enact its own Congressional redistricting plan,” said the lawyers, Richard Mancino and Daniel M. Burstein of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. “Our clients wish that an independent redistricting commission could have drawn these districts, but we are grateful that the independent judiciary stepped in to fill this void and create its own principled plan.”

The court redrew only the Congressional map. The Legislature approved new Senate and Assembly district boundaries last week, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed them into law as part of a deal that included an agreement on a constitutional amendment to modify the redistricting process after the 2020 census. The state’s legislative primary is scheduled for September.

The new legislative maps must be approved by the Justice Department to ensure that they do not disenfranchise minority voters. Democrats in the State Senate are also suing in state court to challenge the addition of a 63rd seat to the Senate, a move that Republicans say is required by the Constitution but that Democrats say is a ploy by Republicans to improve their odds of keeping a majority in the chamber.

The judicial panel’s imposition of the new Congressional lines capped a day of jockeying among prospective candidates, with the bulk of the attention falling on a Queens district, much of which is currently represented by Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat, who unexpectedly announced his retirement last week.

At least three elected officials in Queens have decided to compete in the Democratic primary in June to fill Mr. Ackerman’s seat, and they announced their bids in succession on Monday.

First, the Queens Democratic Party confirmed that it had chosen Assemblywoman Grace Meng as its nominee. Next, Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman, who had been hoping for the nod, said he would run anyway. Then, in a family twist, a city councilwoman, Elizabeth Crowley — a cousin of Representative Joseph Crowley, the Queens Democratic chairman — announced that she, too, was jumping in.",2018-02-11 00:45:58.511581,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,New Congressional Lines Imposed by Federal Court,Thomas Kaplan,,"['Redistricting and Reapportionment', 'Federal Courts (US)', 'New York State', 'State Legislatures', 'Democratic Party', 'Republican Party', 'House of Representatives', 'Elections  House of Representatives', 'Elections  Legislature']",A federal court stepped in after the State Assembly and Senate failed to agree on how to accomplish the redistricting required as a result of the 2010 census.,TIMES TOPIC Redistricting and Reapportionment,,nytimes

2721,2286278.0,elitereaders.com,clickbait,https://www.elitereaders.com/chinese-vlogger-zhang-aloe-vera-feast-agave-americana/,"Thanks to the Internet, there are now numerous platforms for self-expression. Aside from social media, there are sites where anyone can upload videos that can be seen by anyone with an Internet connection. It’s all good — until you throw a poisonous plant into the equation. That’s when all hell breaks loose.

A 26-year-old woman identified only as Zhang has established herself as a video blogger or vlogger. She often goes live when she demonstrates something or tries something new. In her latest live video session, Zhang was discussing the benefits of aloe vera.

She just wanted to stand out.

Aloe vera is a plant that is known for its healing properties. The gel from its leaves is used for a variety of skin conditions — from cold sores to sunburn.

Meanwhile, other studies indicate that aloe vera could help alleviate the complications caused by several ailments. This includes diabetes, asthma, stomach ulcers, and depression.

At first, she hides her pain well — but she eventually abandoned her live stream.

Like on Facebook

Recently, more and more people have also used aloe vera as an ingredient in their health snacks. That’s because it contains a load of antioxidants, as well as folic acid. Obviously, this something that Zhang thought would be on-trend. Thus, she decided to do a live stream of her so-called “Alove Vera Feast” session live to her followers. Initially, her “Aloe Vera Feast” seems to be going well, but then she suddenly felt something different.



Compare: Aloe vera (left) vs. Agave Americana (right)

After she cut off the live stream, Zhang was rushed to the hospital. It turns out that what she had eaten was actually a poisonous plant. The toxic plant was eventually identified as the Agave Americana. The plant, which is native to Mexico, bears some resemblance to aloe vera.

Apparently, the Agave Americana’s sap causes a burning sensation upon contact with skin. If a lot of is ingested, the sap can cause kidney and liver damage. Thankfully, Zhang’s mouth had gone numb and her throat had felt like it was on fire after she ate some Agave Americana leaves. This stopped her from consuming even more of the plant.

Fortunately for Zhang, doctors say she will make a full recovery from her ill-advised ordeal.",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Chinese Vlogger Makes Big Mistake of Eating Poisonous Plant Live on Camera,,,['poisonous plant'],The 26-year-old woman inadvertently ate a poisonous plant that she had mistaken as aloe vera.,"vlogger, poison, china, plants, viral",,

She went so far as to take profound personal offense that anyone could read Kelly’s remarks, which bizarrely pinned that conflict on a generic failure to compromise, as a minimization of slavery. He was pristine. His critics were pigs.

“General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kelly’s “compromise” comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.

She added that journalists’ refusal to brush off those tangents was the truly “outrageous and absurd” development. Thus she aced her favorite trick: the moral inversion of the universe.

Other press secretaries demonized the media, but not as ambitiously and artlessly as she. On Wednesday, she was reminded of her recent statement that all leaders have flaws, and she was asked to name one of Trump’s.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

But if they’re to look away from Trump, why does she so willingly look up to him? And how does she square her faith with the purveyance of so much gobbledygook?

The sheer magnitude of the racial violence against African-Americans, Muslims, Hispanics, Jewish citizens, and many minority groups has shed light on the fact that racism is still alive and abundant in America, despite the perceptions that such hateful actions were on the wane.

Earlier this month, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein went missing from Orange County, CA while visiting his family over the holiday break. Bernstein, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, had been planning to meet with a former classmate of his, 20-year-old Samuel Woodward.

Woodward is believed to have picked up Bernstein from the home of his parents on January 2nd, before driving together to a nearby park where Bernstein’s body would ultimately be found, buried in a shallow grave. Bernstein’s body had more than 20 stab wounds when found.

According to a report by the Los Angeles Times,

‘A law enforcement source said that Woodward told investigators Bernstein kissed him on the lips while they were sitting in a parked car Jan. 2. The sources said Woodward told authorities that the kiss was unwanted and that he pushed Bernstein away, adding that he wanted to call him a “faggot.”‘

Authorities are now looking into the case as a potential hate crime, after finding indications of the suspect’s support for white supremacist and neo-Nazi ideals through his online activity. Woodward had posted fundamentalist and extremist rants supporting white nationalism on fringe websites, as well as having a photo in which he had pretended to stomp a friend’s skull against the curb. The photo is indicative of the infamous murder scene in the film “American History X”, which follows the horrific story of a neo-Nazi extremist.

A gay Jewish man is dead because our society privileges the free speech of fascists over the safety of marginalized folks.#BlazeBernstein https://t.co/DUrCrg3J2g — Megillah Guerrila 🏴🕎👹 (@itsbensiegel) January 23, 2018

Woodward’s online activity spanned a wide range of other similarly hate-fueled beliefs, such as his support for the Confederate flag, and a supposed desire to learn waterboarding. In another instance, a user on one of Woodward’s frequented sites and claiming to be close to the suspect stated that homophobia and anti-semitism were trademarks of his beliefs.

On Wednesday of this week, Woodward appeared in court dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit as the judge ordered he be held without bail, until the arraignment takes place on February 2nd. The 20-year-old man is currently being charged for murder, with the potential of additional charges to follow. Specifically so, this would include the personal use of a knife in committing the murder, which would bring his maximum sentence to a range from 26 years or life in prison, depending on the outcome of the case.

The crime sheds light on the discrimination and violence faced not only by members of any minority group in the country, but most prominently the challenges faced by those in the LGBTQ community. Bernstein’s parents issued a statement after these potential motives were identified, stating that they will not only be shedding a tear for their own son, but also for any other LGBTQ individual that has to live with such fear from violence.

(Before It's News)

Attorney General Loretta Lynch

History renders a hard judgment for a society that eliminates free speech. History shows that very dark days lie ahead when government seeks to control the narrative at any expense.

Loretta Lynch and the Elimination of Free Speech

In the past 60 days, I have been told by multiple sources that I will one day, be prosecuted for anti-Muslim rhetoric by the Federal government. Loretta Lynch is a Muslim, by practice, and isabusing her position to silence any talk against RADICAL and EXTREME Muslim speech even in the aftermath of the murder of 14 Americans by an ISIS sympathizer. This marks the end of the First Amendment in the eyes of the most powerful Justice official, namely, the Attorney General of the United States, and she is a racist to boot.

Lynch is using her position as Attorney General to promote her racist views. One should look at her background as being anti-Jewish when she was a member of the Harvard Black Law Students Association (BLSA) from 1981-1984 who advocated for several anti-Jewish positions. Lynch and the BLSA had their First Amendment rights protected. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, we need to be asking Lynch, who speaks and stands for the Jews?

I do not engage in anti-Muslim rhetoric. However, in the aftermath of several terrorist events (e.g. San Bernardino) I have unashamedly called for all Muslim immigrants, not American citizens, to be screened for suitability to enter the United States. In fact, all immigrants need to screened. After all, if we being forced to give up the Constitution, then we need to screen people who may not have our best interest at heart. Also, if they are unwilling to assimilate, they do not belong here. That means if they expect to bring their Sharia Law and intend it to be a replacement for the Constitution, as many do, then they need to be denied admittance. If there is the slightest hint of terrorism or criminal activity of any kind, then they need to (a) be deported or (b) denied entry. Under Lynch’s new guidelines, this form of free speech is illegal and subjects one to persecution. Lynch was appointed and swore an oath to the Constitution and she is violating her oath of office to destroy it, especially the First Amendment.

In the name of political correctness, I will not support any religious/political doctrine whose intention is to supplant any part of the Constitution. The American people do not owe their country to immigrants who do not add to the quality of American life. As the sign says, we have the right to refuse service to anybody.

At the end of the day, Lynch is not stifling the First Amendment so long your free speech agrees with her idea of free speech.

Lynch’s Lackey Holds the First Amendment In Disdain

“Homegrown violent extremists can be motivated by any viewpoint on the full spectrum of hate—anti-government views, racism, bigotry, anarchy and other despicable beliefs,” John Carlin Assistant Attorney General in charge of anti-domestic terrorism (October 2015)

As one can clearly observe, Assistant Attorney General, the number two person in the Justice Department, disrespects the First Amendment as well. In the quote listed above, John Carlin, is clearly stating that if one disagrees with the government, they are considered (under the Patriot Act) to be a Homegrown violent extremist.

Carlin must have been absent that day in law school when the professor covered the fact that the First Amendment was adopted for the specific purpose of having the right to speak out against the government without concern for reprisal.

Reuters, while describing Carlin’s position, likens domestic, right-wing extremism with anti-governmental views, is guilty of providing “material support” for domestic terrorism.

Further, disagreeing with your government can cause you to “disappear” under the NDAA. Since 9/11, the feds have been engaged in a sequential and incrementally implemented scheme to do away with the First Amendment.

Under this administration, it is a case of “long live the First Amendment, the First Amendment is dead”.

U.S. Army Techniques Publication 3-39.33: Civil Disturbances

Eighteen months ago, I previously reported on the Army’s, August 15, 2014, of how they plan to deal with dissidents and protesters who date to exercise their First Amendment Rights.

The relatively new Army manual, known as ATP 3-39.33, provides discussion and techniques about civil disturbances and crowd control operations that occur in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS).

The following are diagrams lifted from ATP 3-39.33 which instructs soldiers how to kill and disable American citizens who are engaged in civil protests (i.e. protected First Amendment activities).

ATP 3-39.33 speaks to the Army strategy of deploying snipers at public events and protests and “eliminating” the leadership of any such activity who would date to express their First Amendment right to free speech.

This document not only marks the death of the leaders of any civil disobedience, but it marks the death of the First Amendment to the Constitution as it eliminates any right of the people to “peaceably assemble” and to allow the people the full expression of the right “to express grievances” against the government.

On February 22, 2014, I revealed the existence of a classified Army document which has been leaked online, is entitled FM 3-39.40 Internment and Resettlement Operations (PDF). The document was originally to be kept secret, but everyone in the military command structure, as we know, is not on board with the encroaching tyranny sweeping across this country.

Clearly, the leadership of any resistance effort will be targeted with extreme prejudice.

This marks the end of the First Amendment as know it in which speaking out can be met with deadly force.

WHO IS GOING TO BE “ROUNDED UP” IN THE NAME OF ELIMINATING THE FIRST AMENDMENT?

If you’re an anti-abortion activist, or if you display political paraphernalia (e.g. bumper stickers) supporting a third-party candidate (e.g. Ron Paul supporter), if you possess subversive literature (e.g. articles supporting the United States Constitution), if you are a Second Amendment supporter (e.g. gun owner, NRA of GOA member) you very well might be a member of a domestic paramilitary group and the 2009 MIAC report has been used to train law enforcement, nationwide, that people like you are a threat to domestic tranquility.

When the nation first learned of the MIAC report, there was a push back by many Americans. What most Americans did not realize is that this was only the tip of the iceberg for the government in determining who has been naughty or nice. MIAC is one of 58 so-called “fusion centers” nationwide that were created by the Department of Homeland Security, in part, to collect local intelligence so that authorities can use to combat terrorism and related criminal activities.

The fusion centers are only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the data mining as they pale in comparison to the what the NSA is doing. And what are they data mining for? They are looking for people for daring to speak out (i.e. exercising their First Amendment rights) against a tyrannical, anti-Constitutional administration headed by President Obama.

Every American Has a Threat Matrix Score

The American population is assigned a threat matrix score which is compiled by the NSA. It is common knowledge that all forms of communication between and among Americans is monitored by the NSA and entered into a database. The incoming transactional data is analyzed against a continually evolving threat matrix and is assigned an ever-evolving action code. This action code will provide the decision making data on who goes on what kind of terrorist watch list. Things, such as, who flies and who can leave the country, are arbitrarily decided behind closed doors away from public scrutiny.

I believe that ultimately, the questions of the future will not revolve around who flies, but who dies.

According to insider sources, demographic maps have already been created in which red dots appear on a data screen by address of people judged to be a threat as determined by the algorithms derived the NSA protocols.

If you are in the independent media, you are at the top of the list. When the DHS goon squads arrive at our homes at 3AM, we in the alternative media will be going to a FEMA Camp, or worse. And what is our crime? Encouraging citizens to express their positive or negative opinions against this out of control administration.

My sources for years have revealed that the leaders of the resistance are on what could be called a “red list” and will be summarily executed along with their families.

The Verizon and Google data dump to the feds is just the tip of the iceberg. For example, because of cell phone tracking, if you have ever met with a person of concern (e.g. an alternative media figure), your score goes up because your two cell phones came into close proximity. And the longer you meet with this person, the more points are awarded to your threat matrix score. This is a violation of another First Amendment right, the right peaceably assemble.

Keep in mind the Threat Matrix Score is like golf. The goal is to have a low score, that is if you want to live. The person’s score will also rise if they visit the wrong websites, belong to the Libertarian party, own a gun, vote for third party candidates and are a veteran. Many of the sources for the independent media has revealed that demographic maps have already been created in which red dots appear on a data screen by address. The red dots represent people who have received a high score and DHS swat teams will sweep pre-designated areas. The DHS swat teams along with their 2.2 billion rounds of ammunition and 2700 armored personnel carriers will be the vanguard force behind this terrible tyranny.

All others will continue to be placed under extreme surveillance with the threat of removal to a re-education camp or worse. There is a reason why DHS has spent billions on Intellistreet light poles and spy cams at every major intersection. And if you think you can ride this out, read Executive Order 13603. You will be assigned to work wherever this administration wants. Families will be broken apart by this calamity. All of sudden, the CPS tactics and the anti-family courts make a little more sense don’t they? If you are taken to a re-education camp, please consider that your family will be split apart. Men to one camp, women to another and children to a third and you don’t even want to know what my sources tell me about the third kind of camp“.

“I don’t care if the government spies on me and monitors my activities and the statements that I make because I am not doing anything wrong.” Hopefully this article exposes the folly of this thinking.

Conclusion

If you wish to stay mired in the matrix, you will of course see no threat to your existence. Of course none of this will never happen. The government may pass laws which appear on the surface to be quite draconian, however, they would never act upon these laws and Executive Orders. The government may tell you that you, in effect, that your bank deposits are not money and are no longer insured. But they don’t really mean it. The 2.2 billion rounds of ammunition purchased by DHS is only for target practice. And you are the target, for daring to express your First Amendment right to free speech and peaceably assemble. How long will it be until they come after another protected activity, namely, freedom of religion? That day is coming as we are witnessing the incremental dismantling of the First Amendment. This administration and those that follow them must really be up to no good if they are working this hard to stifle free speech.

Let’s be clear. When governments engage in genocide, they first engage in the following progression of events.

Elimination of Free Speech Confiscation of guns. Identification of the “enemy of the State” that must must be eliminated for the safety of all.

The Reds slumped to a 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace in Gerrard's final match at Anfield before he heads to the MLS at the end of the season.

And Rodgers was disappointed his side couldn't put in a better showing to give Gerrard the send off he deserved.

He said: ""We didn't do Steven justice today.

""Steven got a wonderful send off and he gave everything right to the end.

""He was the one who was driving us forward in the game and I though the support was absolutely brilliant, which is what you would expect.

But Rivera, who has eight saves of more than three outs this season, was hesitant to offer too much praise to his peer.

“I don’t say it’s easy,” Rivera said. “But it’s different when you know you’re going in for three guys or two guys or one guy — and that’s it. If you don’t do that, someone else does it. It’s different.”

Rivera continued: “When you have to come in and face two guys in the eighth and sit down for whatever time you have to sit down, and then come back out, regroup and face another three guys, it’s totally different. When you come in from the bullpen, you’re already hot. But when you get two guys in the eighth and sit down, you’re going to cool down. Sometimes the innings are long. You don’t control that.”

In some ways, Rivera has had a more impressive season than Rodríguez. Rivera has 33 saves in 34 chances, while Rodríguez has six blown saves to go with his 55 successes. Rivera has a 1.43 earned run average. Rodríguez’s is 2.49.

By any measure, Rodríguez is a wondrous talent. He has more strikeouts than innings pitched, a three-pitch repertory that now includes a changeup, and 201 saves at age 26. But it is hard for Rivera, 38, to make too much of his season.

“I don’t see the record as a crazy thing,” Rivera said. “The reason why is, as a closer, you need all the opportunities. I wouldn’t say it’s a milestone, because it’s just opportunity. Basically, that’s what it is — opportunity for one year. But what I can say is you have to be able to do it day in and day out, and K-Rod has done that.”

Rodríguez is making $10 million this season, and he told The Los Angeles Times last weekend that he was eager to test his market value in free agency. Rodríguez has not ruled out a return to the Angels, but he is believed to be seeking a five-year contract for $75 million.

The Mets could be tempted after learning that Billy Wagner’s elbow injury may sideline him for all of next season. But the price might be too high for the Angels, who could turn the job over to a setup man like Scot Shields or José Arredondo.

Rodríguez has pitched his whole career for the Angels, joining them as a late-season sensation for their 2002 championship run. But first baseman Mark Teixeira is another free agent who will command a high salary, putting Rodríguez’s return in doubt.

“I’ve never been on a team without him, without a good closer,” Angels starter John Lackey said. “I don’t know what it would be like. It’s probably something you don’t know until you miss him. The organization definitely has a lot of decisions to make.”

Teixeira said the Angels’ late-inning relief had been the biggest reason for their success. It is impossible to ignore the coming contract talks, Teixeira said, but it is secondary to the Angels’ bigger goals. At 87-56 through Monday, they had the best record in baseball.

“It’s always in the back of our minds, but we have a chance to do something special here,” Teixeira said. “Everyone in this locker room has some situation in the future they have to worry about. But our goal is to win every night and win in October, and that’s what we’re focused on.”

When Rodríguez does hit free agency, Rivera’s contract will probably be a benchmark in negotiations. Rivera signed a three-year, $45 million deal last season, making him the highest-paid closer in history.

“I don’t like to talk about myself, but I’ve been doing it for 12 years,” Rivera said. “You cannot compare that to another unless you have done it for the same time. But, definitely, that mark has been set up. It’s up to the teams whether they want to do it or not.”

J. Simpson trial, for instance, or anything involving John Gotti Jr. But you won’t find a case with more “all” than the one nearly a century ago surrounding an Atlanta pencil factory superintendent named Leo Frank. It is mesmerizingly recreated and explored Monday on PBS in “The People v. Leo Frank,” a film by Ben Loeterman that even those already familiar with this ugly piece of history are likely to find unsettling.

The case began with the murder of a 13-year-old worker at Frank’s factory, Mary Phagan, in 1913, but it was not destined to remain a simple homicide. The authorities eventually focused on Frank, who was part of a Jewish middle class that was beginning to find life uncomfortable in Atlanta as a new wave of immigration heightened fears and prejudices.

Also implicated was a black janitor named Jim Conley, and Frank’s murder trial essentially came down to whether the white male jury was going to take the word of a black man or a Jew from Brooklyn. There were lurid accusations that Frank took sexual liberties with his young employees, and there were sensationalist headlines that raised the already high temperature. Frank was convicted, but the tale still had a long way to run.

“Leo’s death sentence would ignite a form of hatred not seen before in the United States,” the film’s narrator says.

Photo

Adolph Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, took up the question, giving the unfolding story prominent play and sending reporters to Georgia who concluded that Frank had been wrongly convicted. The South’s reaction to meddling from the North was just what you would expect. What would today be called a media frenzy took hold, and the tone couldn’t have been more vicious.

Even so, what happened after a courageous governor commuted Frank’s sentence in 1915 from death to life in prison seems shocking beyond modern-day belief. If you don’t know the dénouement (the story has been dramatized before, including in the 1998 Broadway musical “Parade” that is now in revival in Los Angeles), it’s worth tuning in to see just how thin our veneer of civility really is.

Didn't I just write that the Board voted weeks ago to have this issue taken up at a Public Safety Committee meeting? Why, yes I did. So how did it get on the agenda of the full Board of Supervisors? No one seemed to know for sure, or at least be willing to own up to it. But one thing seemed certain, as I tweeted:



JP Massar @jpmassar

@OaktownMike @marymad Just called my rep. Got his CoS. Says ""item was put on agenda inside of another item."" Dirty shit goin' down #oo @nomby

Michael Siegel @OaktownMike

You all must work fast! Just got call from Alameda County counsel, saying Sheriff WILL NOT seek approval for drone tomorrow. #agitationworks

Not long after that Michael Siegel, legal counsel for ACAD, tweetedDanger apparently averted. But to be safe, a press conference was called for 10:00 AM today (Tuesday), to highlight this smoke-filled-room-like tactic and call more attention down on the drone issue. A good thing too!

When, after the press conference, we finally made it into the Board of Supervisors meeting hall to find out what was what, it turned out that the offending item -- the authorization to accept the grant money -- had not been excised from the agenda; well, not exactly. Only the subitem specifically noting that $$32,000 of the grant money was to be used to buy a drone had been excised. But since the entirety of the grant money was to be accepted by the motion, that $$32,000 would still have been available to the sheriff to buy the drone! (In other words, while there wouldn't have been specific authorization to buy the drone, there wouldn't have been any clause that said he couldn't buy the drone, and, via the grant, he would have had the money to buy the drone... And since he WANTED to buy the drone...)

Complicated? Yes.

But thanks to the ACLU's eagle-eyed Linda Lye, who has been working with ACAD closely on this issue, this Catch-22 was, well, caught, and in a flurry of activity before the public portion of the meeting began, she got the motion amended. Here's how it went down:



Linda Lye @linda_lye

Chief admin ofcr pulled req for drone auth from supes' agenda but draft resolution wld still authorize ACSO to receive and admin drone $$ Linda Lye @linda_lye

Asking supervisor valle to ask for amendment to sheriffs' resolution to make sure drones not authorized Linda Lye @linda_lye

Unless language of resolution on item 22 changed, it would mean no pub comment or bd discussion but blanket approval of drone. Linda Lye @linda_lye

Let's see what county counsel has to say about my request to change language of resolution on grant funds. Linda Lye @linda_lye

Yay. Supervisor Carson amended resolution to say no drones. Board will take up issue at public protection cmte in jan. Linda Lye @linda_lye

@JanetRWeil Thanks to everyone for turning out. I think Sheriff and Bd of Supes got the message that drones are not getting rammed thru. Linda Lye @linda_lye

drone on agenda by ""oversight""? if true, still shows sheriff wasn't taking concerns seriously. you wouldn't accidentally put nuke on agenda.

So...

Indeed, a very tiny -- but important -- victory. While the use of police drones may be spreading rapidly around the country, there will -- for the nonce -- be no Sheriff's drones flying over Alameda County, video recording terroristic Occupiers attempting to feed the hungry and keep people in their homes.

After all, we already have the Oakland Police for that.

5088,3064837.0,galacticconnection.com,junksci,http://galacticconnection.com/eff-to-court-border-agents-need-warrants-to-search-contents-of-digital-devices/,"Whether Conducted Manually or Using Forensic Software, Cell Phone Searches Are Highly Intrusive

New Orleans, Louisiana—Searches of mobile phones, laptops, and other digital devices by federal agents at international airports and U.S. land borders are highly intrusive forays into travelers’ private information that require a warrant, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said in a court filing yesterday.

EFF urged the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to require law enforcement officers at the border to obtain a warrant before performing manual or forensic searches of digital devices. Warrantless border searches of backpacks, purses, or luggage are allowed under an exception to the Fourth Amendment for routine immigration and customs enforcement. Yet EFF argues that, since digital devices can provide so much highly personal, private information—our contacts, our email conversations, our work documents, our schedules—agents should be required to show they have probable cause to believe that the device contains evidence of a violation of the immigration or customs laws. Only after a judge has signed off on a search warrant should border agents be allowed to rifle through the contents of cell phones, laptops, or tablets.



Digital device searches at the border have more than doubled since the inauguration of President Trump. This increase, along with the increasing number of people who carry these devices while traveling, has highlighted the need for stronger privacy rights while crossing the U.S. border.

“Our cell phones and laptops provide access to an unprecedented amount of detailed, private information, often going back many months or years, from emails to our coworkers to photos of our loved ones and lists of our closest contacts. This is light years beyond the minimal information generally contained in other kinds of personal items we might carry in our suitcases. It’s time for courts and the government to acknowledge that examining the contents of a digital device is highly intrusive, and Fourth Amendment protections should be strong, even at the border,” said EFF Staff Attorney Sophia Cope.

EFF filed its brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in U.S. v. Molina-Isidoro. In that case, Maria Isabel Molina-Isidoro’s cell phone was manually searched at the border, supporting her prosecution for attempting to import methamphetamine into the country.

The Supreme Court has held that cell phones hold “the privacies of life,” and police need a warrant to search the contents of a phone seized during an arrest. The same principle should apply to the digital devices seized at the border, EFF told the appeals court.

“Any search of data stored on a digital device, whether performed using special forensic software or conducted manually after obtaining and entering the owner’s password, provides access to a person’s entire private life,” said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Adam Schwartz.

EFF is urging the court to find that the extraordinary privacy interests that travelers have in their digital devices render warrantless searches of those devices unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Border agents should be required to show they have sufficient cause for this immense invasion of privacy.

With this loss, they went winless on a three-game trip.

“I thought the energy was low to begin with,” Fisher said.

Carmelo Anthony missed his second straight game after he experienced back spasms in Monday’s loss to the Houston Rockets. The good news for the Knicks was that Anthony said he could sense progress after working out for about an hour before the game.

“Much better, considering the fact that maybe a day and a half ago, I couldn’t even walk, couldn’t get out of bed,” Anthony said.

His teammates were ambulatory against the Thunder (5-12), although even that seemed debatable at times.

As for Westbrook, he exploded to the rim for a dunk. Heading for a layup, he wove past a series of defenders as if they were traffic cones. He drained a 3-pointer. He dumped the ball to Serge Ibaka, who barreled to the hoop and dunked over Jason Smith. All this, and the game was barely eight minutes old.

“It just seemed like we were a little flat,” Fisher said.

Westbrook had 14 points and 4 assists as the Thunder ran out to a 30-13 lead by the end of the first quarter. He hardly looked winded. The Knicks, on the other hand, were gasping for air. And then things got really bad. At one point in the second quarter, the Knicks were 4 of 28 from the field.

Oklahoma City was up by 28 late in the first half when Fisher called for a timeout. Westbrook raised his arms, and the noise level in the building went from loud to head-splitting. Jose Calderon pounded his fist against the ball — once, twice, three times. Fisher put his hands on his hips, powerless to do much of anything in his suit and tie.

The game was a homecoming of sorts for Fisher, who closed out his playing career with the Thunder before he accepted the Knicks’ coaching job in June. Before the game, Fisher had anticipated that the reunion would be emotional for him.

“They took me in and shined me up a little bit, and I was part of something special there for a couple years,” he said.

Fisher received a warm reception from the crowd during introductions, and then all those fuzzy feelings evaporated. Westbrook, who had missed 14 straight games, shot 8 of 11 from the field in the first half as the Thunder went ahead by 59-33. Kevin Durant, still sidelined while he recovers from a broken foot, danced near the bench.

Anthony could have helped the Knicks, had he been in any condition to play. He said he could recall little of the Knicks’ charter flight to Dallas from Houston earlier in the week. He remembers leaving the arena. He remembers going to an urgent care center to receive pain medication. He remembers boarding the plane. And then?

“The next thing I know, I was in Dallas,” he said. “That’s the only thing I remember.”

So his workout before Friday’s game qualified as a success. He took some shots. He jogged. He joked with team officials that he was ready to play.

“And they looked at me like I had six heads out there,” he said. “So it’s just a matter of sticking with the program.”

Anthony sustained the injury when he landed awkwardly after sinking a jump shot in the second quarter against the Rockets. His back seized up, he said, and after he went to the bench for a timeout, he needed help getting to his feet. He attempted to play, he said, before Fisher called another timeout to remove him for good.

“Never experienced any type of pain like that,” Anthony said.

He estimated that his spasms had dissipated by about “80 percent,” which was good news — but not great, not minutes before the opening tip against the Thunder, with his teammates preparing to fend for themselves. It was too much for them to handle.",2018-02-11 00:47:57.257373,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"In Return to Thunder, Westbrook Dominates the Knicks",Scott Cacciola,,"['Basketball', 'Westbrook  Russell', 'Anthony  Carmelo', 'Oklahoma City Thunder', 'New York Knicks']","Carmelo Anthony missed his second straight game for the Knicks, who struggled to keep up with a Thunder team that benefited from Russell Westbrook’s return.",,,nytimes

By Covert Geopolitics

After realizing that the US Congress’s move to allow the filing of charges against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its supposed role in the “terrorist” attack on New York in 2001 could be Washington DC’s way of putting the House of Saud on notice — that it, too, is not exempt from its two-faced foreign policy, and could be a future target for a regime change once it ceases to be a willing subject to systematic extortion, like what’s being done with Japan for decades right after the Second World War, the House of Saud continues to engage Russia for a possible common ground.

Russia is responding positively to the Saudi initiative, and already the two are defying the pressure from the latter’s long-time “ally.”

Russia Calling the Shots on ‘American Playground’ in Middle East

Sputnik / Evgeniya Novozhenova

Russia continues to develop relations with Saudi Arabia, Washington’s longstanding ally in the Middle East. In addition to the ongoing cooperation in the energy sphere, the two countries are expected to launch lucrative investment projects and probably start working together in the defense sector.

Russia continues to compete with Washington on the US’ traditional “playground” in the Middle East.

On April 6, the Russian Foreign Ministry made an important statement on the Palestinian-Israeli settlement, recognizing East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state and West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Commenting on the issue, Israeli political analyst Avigdor Eskin told Sputnik that Russia has surpassed the US by recognizing West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

“The current statement regarding the recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel reflects a warm and friendly atmosphere [between Russia and Israel]. This is highly appreciated,” the Israeli political analyst underscored.

“Russia is much closer to the region and has a deeper understanding of the situation. If Trump remains ‘under siege’ and doesn’t prevail for the rest of his term, we might expect a stronger Russian influence,” Eskin predicted.

But that is not all.

On Monday a Russian parliamentary delegation, headed by Federation Council Chair Valentina Matvienko, concluded its visit to Saudi Arabia, Washington’s other key ally in the Middle East.

Assessing the results of the summit, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said that contacts between Moscow and Riyadh are expanding at various levels.

“Indeed, there is a deepening of mutual understanding between our countries; contacts are taking place at all levels,” he said during a meeting with the head of The King Salman Center for Humanitarian Aid and Relief.

As expected, the cooperation in the oil and gas spheres had become the centerpiece of the negotiations between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Moscow and Riyadh continue to take steps to reduce oil production to balance the market.

The countries have fully complied with all their obligations under the agreement between OPEC and other oil-producing countries.

“Russia and Saudi Arabia acted as guarantors of the implementation of this agreement, and I am sure that this cooperation will continue, because no one is interested in a chaotic development of events [in the oil market],” Matvienko said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.

Interestingly enough, following the oil price slump, there was speculation that Washington had persuaded Riyadh to dump prices to spite Russia. However, Moscow and Riyadh are currently successfully working together to establish an equitable pricing strategy in the energy market.

Furthermore, although Riyadh remains close to the US, the Kingdom didn’t support anti-Russian sanctions imposed by other Washington’s allies, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

In addition, the Russians and their Saudi counterparts discussed the prospect of cooperating in the defense sector. While the details of the talks have yet to be disclosed, it is known that in late 2016, Saudi Arabia showed interest in potentially purchasing Russian S-400 Triumf air defense systems.

“This has been stated by Saudi Arabian representatives themselves when they visited multiple exhibitions, presentations and shows where Russia showcased these systems, such as the exhibition in Abu Dhabi [the International Defense Exhibition and Conference, IDEX]and events organized in Russia, so there is nothing new here, there is an interest,” Russian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Oleg Ozerov told Sputnik in early November 2016.

In February 2017 Industry and Trade Minister of Russia Denis Manturov confirmed that Russia and Saudi Arabia were discussing Riyad’s prospects for acquiring Russian military aircraft and “land weapons.”

It is no secret that Washington has long been Riyadh’s key arms provider and the country boasts an annual defense budget second to only that of the United States and China. Recent developments show that Russia is beginning to compete with the US for the Kingdom’s lucrative military contracts.

Meanwhile, Matvienko revealed that the Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund will launch joint projects worth $$3 billion before the end of this year.

“The Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund are cooperating successfully. Thanks to them, projects worth some $$600 million have been implemented. Before the end of the year, projects worth $$3 billion should be launched,” she said.

However, there are also bumps in the road regarding Russo-Saudi relations: Riyadh and Moscow have completely different approaches toward Syria and Iran. On the other hand, the two countries have similar views regarding the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

“Moscow and Riyadh have similar positions on the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” Deputy Chairperson of the Council of the Federation Ilyas Umakhanov told RIA Novosti.

“As for Syria, we have very serious differences regarding the fate of [Syrian] President Bashar al-Assad, but Russia and Saudi Arabia agree that there can be no military solution to this crisis,” he said.

According to Matvienko, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud may visit Russia by the end of 2017.

What this illustrates is that Russia has departed from its age old policy of not taking any proactive role in global affairs, now that more and more countries have grown weary and tired of the incessant warmongering from the Western side,

… and are looking for a more positive leadership that they can only find from Vladimir Putin.

Likewise, Saudi’s growing engagement with East Asia and Russia will only result to a stronger cooperation with the BRICS Alliance and ASEAN countries, and will further alienate the kingdom from the West.

They don’t want to be used as a tool again for Western terror aggression anywhere in the world.

Just a week ago, the current chairman of the ASEAN, Rodrigo went to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for an official state visit.

The Philippine president is known for his censor-free anti-CIA sentiments in front of foreign leaders. This occasion is no exception.

Duterte’s tour to the Middle East also included visits to Bahrain and Qatar.

The geopolitical realignment continues with the recent port call to Manila by the Russian navy.

This is just a prelude to Duterte’s state visit to Russia soon.

As for Saudi Arabia, 800 US families are already filing a lawsuit against it relating to the controlled demolition directed by Dick Cheney. But the former has already made its decision to leave the deplorables on their own.

Since, this realignment is a very long process, and the deplorables are still holding great positions of power, it is only wise to expect some bumps along the way.

TOWIE girl Chloe Sims almost suffered a nip slip as she attended the ITV Gala in a racy outfit. The risqué dress left very little to the imagination of the viewer.

Nip Slip

Her killer body was on display for all the guests of the Gala. For a time it seemed as if she has the deepest cleavage in the entire industry.

Her boobs were oozing out of the dress and for a moment it seemed that there is going to be a nip slip, when the young actress strutted on the red carpet.

It was also noticeable that the fabric of the racy dress was only barely concealing her nipples. Fortunately for her, the imminent danger of nip slip was averted and she remained out of the list of celebrities whose nipples had been exposed in public view. Everybody was turning heads when they saw Chloe Sims arriving at the ITV Gala Thursday night.

While, the low cut red dress culminated in an eye popping display. Her full bust was eased into a sweet heart neckline as the sultry actress did her best Jessica Rabbit impression. This was not all that the reality TV star did to the guests at the Gala.

Citizens United, The Movie, on Kickstarter

(Image by The PEN) Permission Details DMCA

My guest today is progressive political activist and frequent OpEdNews contributor, The Pen . Welcome back to OpEdNews, PEN.

Joan Brunwasser: I understand that you have a Kickstarter project to make Citizens United, the Movie . Tell us how it's going.

The Pen: It's really amazing the amount of attention we're attracting. Of course, of all the issues we've ever confronted, more of our people have spoken out on this than anything else, and by a very wide margin. Since the original decision was announced in the Citizens United Supreme Court case [2010], we've had requests for upwards of 50,000 bumper stickers related to this, most of which we sent out entirely for free. Here, we are making a full-length feature, narrative movie to dramatize this, and we launched on Kickstarter more than anything to give the project real visibility in the not-preaching-to-the-choir world. And it's working right out of box.

JB: Tell us more, please.

PEN: Kickstarter, as you probably know, has become the number one go to place for independent filmmakers to get their projects off the ground. Even famous, established directors are now doing this. And even competing with all the thousands of others trying to do the Kickstarter thing, in just five days we reached our initial goal and shot up into the top 10 most popular of all Kickstarter movie projects. If support continues to pour in, a WHOLE lot of people are going to ask, ""What's this??"" It's already happening. And that's exactly the kind of exposure we need, not just to get the movie made, but also to actually build the momentum to amend the constitution for real, to abolish corporate personhood and shut down the gross perversion of our democracy by unlimited special interest corporate political spending.

And we're not just getting financial support. The first thing we posted on Kickstarter was a video of a faux defense contractor TV PR ad, which we will use in the movie to make a point of the extent to which corporations, and military war profiteers in particular, have taking over the concept of ""the people."" We put together some spectacular video clips for this sequence, a cockpit view of a fighter jet streaking away from the deck of an aircraft carrier over sparkling waters, a military satellite in orbit with the sun glinting off the curvature of the earth, and a missile armed attack drone in flight that virtually flies down our throats, and more. You really have to see it.

- Advertisement -

All we needed to finish this scene was to get real actors in to replace the stand-in voiceover we used to write the scene. And we were asking people on Kickstarter to contribute to help make that happen, and to get the cameras rolling for the other scenes planned for our day one shoot.

Well . . . we immediately started hearing from top professional voice narrators, literally from all over the world, offering to record tracks in their own facilities. That's how much people really want to see this movie get made.

JB: How gratifying.

PEN: We've got all kinds of magical scenes planned. The movie opens with a hypothetical conversation between founding fathers James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, based on their own letters and speeches, talking about the propriety of chartering a national bank, and the appropriate limits on corporations in general, which were rare entities in colonial days. This will all be in authentic colonial costumes, against a true-to-life background we already have pictures of, and we've even acquired a real antique book from the 18th century as a prop.

JB: Powerful. Great idea.

PEN: Then later in the film, we are going to have an encounter between Supreme Court Justices Stevens and Kennedy in the Supreme Court robing room (for which we have an incredible architectural visualization artist to do the recreations), where they casually debate the upcoming Citizens United decision. And we're going to have Madison and Hamilton appear there again, ghostlike off to the side, commenting on how badly their own words have been twisted.

- Advertisement -

JB: I love it!

PEN: It's going to be so much fun. And from the practical hands-on experience of making our first movie, we know we can accomplish all of this the first shoot day, and more.

And of course, all of this is all the more urgent in light of the latest Supreme Court outrage, which just came down today [April 2, 2014] in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, essentially striking down whatever campaign contribution limits remained. This comes as no surprise. Justices Roberts and Alito were installed precisely to render these kinds of democracy-killing decisions, and are already in the top 10 of corporate-favoring justices ever. Our courts have always recognized before that allowing the very wealthy to have an inordinate sized thumb on the scales of our political process was a bad thing. But no more.

The Organic Prepper

Daisy Luther

Shopping malls across America are going to look a whole lot emptier soon. An exodus of giant retailers is beginning with the announcement of hundreds of store closures and thousands of people newly unemployed.

The first of January, I broke with my usual tradition and wrote not about positive resolutions, but about the impending rockslide of the US economy. And “rockslide” is an apt word: as one thing starts rolling down the mountain, it will pick up other things until a veritable avalanche of other businesses and people are affected and rolling pell-mell right alongside.

Last year, we saw announcements of the expected closure of some retail giants. In February of 2013, Michael Snyder wrote on The Economic Collapse Blog that we would see the following:

Best Buy Forecast store closings: 200 to 250 Sears Holding Corp. Forecast store closings: Kmart 175 to 225, Sears 100 to 125 J.C. Penney Forecast store closings: 300 to 350 Office Depot Forecast store closings: 125 to 150 Barnes & Noble Forecast store closings: 190 to 240, per company comments Gamestop Forecast store closings: 500 to 600 OfficeMax Forecast store closings: 150 to 175 RadioShack Forecast store closings: 450 to 550

Unfortunately, it didn’t stop there. This morning, a World News Daily report announced:

Macy’s is closing 14 of its 790 stores across the country. JCPenney is closing 39 of its stores and laying off 2,250 workers. Sears has been around for 122 years, but it, too, is closing 235 under-performing stores. C. Wonder, the preppy retailer, is going out of business, closing all 11 of its U.S. stores in the next few weeks. Wet Seal is closing 338 retail stores while dealing with bankruptcy proceedings. Nearly 3,700 full- and part-time workers will be unemployed. Aeropostale, suffering from declining sales, closed 75 stores during the holiday season, which runs from November through January. And in 2015, they expect to close an additional 50 to 75 stores. RadioShack, which is negotiating with lenders to gain approval to shutter 1,100 stores, said last month that it closed 175 locations in 2014. (source)

Even holiday sales, normally high, plummeted this Christmas.

How does this affect you?

You may not work in retail yourself, but never doubt that the mass closure of these businesses will directly affect you..

Maybe you are wondering how. You aren’t much of a shopper. You aren’t a retail worker. Perhaps you believe you can compartmentalize this information, pack it away, and go on with your life as you always have.

The thing is, it’s not just the patrons and employees of these stores who are affected. This is going to be catastrophic on a variety of levels.

Let’s go a little bit deeper.

Think about the people who worked in these stores. Now, they’re without jobs. There will be more competition for the smaller number of jobs in America, and many people will not be able to find work. They’ll survive by going on assistance, draining the US coffers even more. As formerly employed people search for work that just isn’t there, we’ll see an increase in foreclosures, repossessions, and welfare.

Think about those who provided the inventory for these stores. Yes, I know a lot of it was made in other countries. But, it was imported here and distributed here. Most businesses work on a “Net-30″ basis, meaning the inventory is delivered, and the payment for that inventory is due in 30 days. And guess what? The companies that imported the merchandise aren’t going to get paid. This will ripple through and cause other businesses to go under, which means still more people are unemployed.

Think about those who transport the inventory. Trucking companies and the independent operators who drive the trucks won’t get money owed to them either. As companies struggle to keep trucks on the road, transport costs will go up, which will cause future inventory in stores to be priced higher.

This is how we’ll be affected:

The price of everything is going to go up because wary distributors are going to try to recoup what they’ve lost from these companies that went under, while transporters increase prices to try to cover losses.

Jobs will be even harder to get than they were previously – and looking at the unemployment rates, it was pretty darned difficult before.

When people have no jobs, they spend no money, crushing the manufacturer’s and retailer’s economy even more.

As financial desperation increases, so will crime. And it won’t just be property crime – expect an uptick in violence as property owners fight back.

If you don’t live in an entirely self-sufficient bubble, you can bet you’ll be affected in one way or another.

What can you do about the collapsing economy?

It’s more vital than ever to be aware of what’s going on and to start getting prepared for it on all levels. You need to consider the following:

Create multiple streams of income. We’d all like to feel like we’re reliably employed, but that’s just not true. You need only to look at the numbers above to see that jobs can be ephemeral. You need to be making money from more than one source (multiple streams of income). Start a small business that provides a safety net. Check out this great article on Graywolf Survival for more information on how to do it.

Learn to shop wisely. A couple of years ago, I wrote this article about how shopping wisely can save you a fortune on your regular purchases. Each purchase needs to be thought out carefully because the day may come when your own personal economic collapse occurs in the form of a job loss, an illness, or a catastrophic bill.

Build a pantry. A well-stocked larder can be your lifeline in the event that your personal finances take a hit. Your supply of food, toiletries, and household items can mean the difference between weathering a storm in relative comfort or going under completely. When I got laid off from my job in the automotive industry, it took 4 weeks before the severance pay arrived, and 9 weeks before my unemployment insurance kicked in. We were able to survive in total comfort due to the supplies we had laid in, and the lower amount of money I was receiving was enough to cover things like the mortgage, car payments, and utilities. Check out my book on building a one-year food supply in 3 months. Another option (although not as thrifty) is to stock up on freeze-dried food for your family. The nice thing is, you can put this at the back of your closet until the day you need it. It’s packaged for the long haul in buckets and it keeps for ages.

Learn to do it yourself. Really, the epitome of preparedness is self-sufficiency. Only when you reduce your dependence on the economy can you be truly unaffected by the things going on in retail-land. Grow it, make it, build it. No matter where you live, you can take steps towards personal independence. The last half of this book is all about being as self-reliant as possible - it’s a must-read. Learn to live like there are no stores, and if a day comes when there aren’t, you’ll be just fine. Learn skills like canning, sewing , andhomesteading , and figure out how to apply them to your personal situation. Also, don’t just learn them: DO THEM.

Learn to live on less (and enjoy it). When my oldest daughter was a newborn, my husband lost his job. We went through the toughest financial period I ever faced. Quite literally, at one point we had 2 bags of bagels in our freezer, half a jar of peanut butter, and the desperate hope that our vegetable garden would produce enough to get us through until unemployment checks started arriving or a new job was found. I read a book (borrowed from the library and signed out for the maximum allowed number of times) that completely changed my life. If you haven’t read The Complete Tightwad Gazette, I strongly encourage you to read this gigantic bible of frugality from cover to cover. I still hear Amy Dacyzyn’s “voice” in my head sometimes and my own work is strongly influenced by those lessons she taught me back when I was a new mama. Here’s an article to get you in the frugal mindset.

If you can’t protect it, you don’t own it. Lots of people hate this part, but it’s true. You absolutely must have a strategy for protecting your home and family. That means you need weapons. You need to figure out how to harden your property against attacks. You must be mentally and physically prepared for the increase in crime that comes with the increase in desperation. I know in my small, sleeping town, property crimes have been on the rise, and sadly, violent crimes are popping up now when they were so rare as to be an anomaly before. This article talks about hardening your home, and this one tells you how to prepare your home for battle, should things really go awry.

Have you seen evidence of this collapse?

How are things in your neck of the woods? I know that where I live, some of the nearby malls are turning into ghost towns. Crime has been steadily rising for the past six months. I personally know several people who have lost their jobs recently due to the closure of the businesses with whom they were employed. Have you seen evidence of this financial downturn? Let’s compare notes in the comments section below.

Resources:

The economy is indeed collapsing, but for most of us, there’s still time to get prepared. If your own situation has collapsed, don’t despair – there are ways to live very well on less. Here are some resources to help you become more self-reliant and less dependent on the financial well-being of others.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

On display at the Jesse James Firearms Unlimited booth at SHOT Show 2018, is a beautiful hand-made 1911 pistol that James made for his good friend Donald J. Trump. The pistol is on display at the booth (#411) until Jan. 26.

When Trump became the president, James felt an obligation to make his friend a gun. “I build cool guns. So, it’s like, I’m going to build a presidential gun,” he said.

Setting out to build the gun, James wanted to capture the essence of Trump. “Donald Trump’s kind of old school, like 1970s,” James said. “You know, New York City rich guy. So, a little bit of gold, a little bit of decorative filigree work.”

Being the 45th president of the United States, of course the gun had to be a large 1911 in .45ACP. James used one of his Grandmaster X seven-inch 1911 model frames as a base, and added a two-inch comp to the barrel to bring the total length of the pistol to nine inches. This gave him enough real estate to be able to write the president’s entire name down one side “Donald J. Trump.” On the other side he put, “The 45th President of the United States of America.”

“It’s kind of like, a modern Dirty Harry gun,” said James. “He’s kind of bigger than life, I think. So he needs a bigger than life pistol.”

James only made one of the gun and he hasn’t spoken to Trump about it. He figures he’ll probably make a trip to the White House and present the gun to his friend. However, if he does this in a formal fashion, by law, the gun then becomes the property of the people. So Trump wouldn’t be able to keep it.

To this Jesse said, “I guess I shouldn’t bitch about having a pistol in the presidential museum.”

Cheap pen displays from no-name Chinese companies like Yiynova, P-Active and Bosto have begun appearing for sale on, for example, Amazon — and they cost as little as $300.

Photo

“These probably aren’t quite as good as the Wacom,” a reader, Evan Schultz, told me by e-mail, “but did you see that difference in price? For that sort of price break, this may shape up like the battle between the wonderful $600 iPad and the good-enough $200 Kindle.” Indeed it might.

Mr. Schultz went on to note that if these cut-rate tablets were any good, they might be useful to more people than just digital artists. “Lawyers and journalists who need to edit documents, doctors who want to take notes in medical journals, anyone who wants to use a pen to write instead of a keyboard. It’s been a small market up until now, but the competition might open up the technology to all sorts of people.”

Well, Mr. Schultz, this column’s for you — and for all those interested lawyers, journalists, doctors and handwriting aficionados. To see just how little you get for your $300, I pitted two of the cheapies — the 10- and 19-inch tablets from Yiynova — against Wacom’s 21-inch model, the $2,000 Cintiq 21UX.

The Cintiq is a beast. At 22.4 pounds, it takes two hands, and preferably two people, to unbox it and seat it into its stand. Once installed there, the screen tips to whatever angle is comfortable for your drawing — nearly flat like a desk, if you like — and rotates 180 degrees in either direction, which is fantastic when you’re shading or crosshatching.

A fat black cable snakes out of the screen and splits into a Medusa’s haircut of connectors: video, USB and power. The USB and video jacks connect to your Mac or PC, just as a regular external monitor might. In fact, you could use the Cintiq as your main monitor, although it’s dimmer than dedicated monitors.

Then you install the driver software. You calibrate the screen by tapping it in four prescribed spots with the stylus, which teaches the thing how you like to hold the pen. Finally, you open up a painting or 3-D program like Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel Painter, Manga Studio or Maya 3D, and put pen to screen.

There’s brief lag, especially with high-resolution artwork, between a pen stroke and the appearance of its “ink,” and there’s a tiny glass gap between the tip of your pen and the image itself.

But after a few minutes, you’ll be just as delighted and productive as the artists who proudly demo their Cintiqs on YouTube . It feels as if you’re drawing on paper; the tip doesn’t skate on the glass. The whole thing feels incredibly precise and smooth.

As you work, you can slide your finger up or down the back edge to zoom in or out, which is very handy. With the tap of a button, you can change the function of this touch strip so that it enlarges or shrinks your painting brush, or moves through your Photoshop layers, or rotates the entire canvas. There are 16 other programmable buttons on the front.

You can easily switch the pen’s function from painting to mousing: to move the cursor without leaving a line, you lift the tip slightly off the glass. There are right-click and double-click buttons on the pen’s shaft. The top of the pen acts like an eraser in most programs. The verdict: sweet — and costly.

After driving the Mercedes of pen displays for a while, I test-drove the Toyota Yaris equivalent: the Yiynova DP10 ($300), sold in the United States by ThePandaCity.com .

This screen is a thin, 1.5-pound white-plastic slab that you can easily hold with one hand as you draw, although it has a kickstand on the back too. Unlike the Cintiq, the DP10 requires no wall power and no connection to your computer’s video jack. Instead, amazingly, you connect it to your PC with a single black USB cable. (Well, one cable with a forked tongue. It requires two USB jacks to get the power it needs.)

I had a difficult time getting it running, and the Amazon user reviews indicate that I’m not alone. The manual’s English will not, ahem, remind you of Hemingway. (The tablet’s description on Amazon gives you a taste: “Provider an intuitive way to use the pen directly on screen to make holograph, handwritten signatures, and schetch.”)

The company cheerfully helped me over the phone and by e-mail, but here, too, language was occasionally a barrier. And the DP10 works best on a Windows PC. It can run on a Mac, but flakily.

Photo

If you make it through the setup, though, you’ll realize that the low price, light weight and surprising portability give the DP10 some fascinating possibilities. The screen is bright and clear. The stylus works in the usual graphics programs, complete with pressure sensitivity. (Zoom, scroll and brightness buttons line the left side.)

It also works with the tablet features of Windows — handwriting recognition, for example. Only the smallish screen (1,024 by 600 pixels) and its slippery surface detract from the experience.

My final experiment involved that tablet’s big brother, the Yiynova MSP19. This is a bigger, heavier, 19-inch touch screen, closer in effect to the Cintiq — but with a $500 price tag.

The picture is sharp and vibrant, and the construction quality is impressive. It does the job extremely well.

Of course, let’s not kid ourselves: the Cintiq is superior in a hundred little ways. For example, its stylus never needs a battery, and there’s an eraser on the top. If you sketch quickly, the ink lags your pen tip less on the Cintiq, too.

But suppose you don’t work at Pixar. Suppose you can’t swing $2,000 right now. In that case, you’ll find the cheaper models to be surprisingly good for the price; for students, amateurs and note-takers of every stripe, they present a fascinating middle-ground option between all and nothing.

Put another way, the Cintiq may be a luxury yacht — but the Yiynova is no Chinese junk.",2018-02-11 00:46:04.413597,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,The Joy of Drawing on Glass,"David Pogue, State Of The Art",,"['Tablet Computers', 'Computers and the Internet', 'Art', 'iPad']","Unleash your inner artist with a new category of pen display tablets, ones that won’t clean out your bank account.",,,nytimes

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The study of exoplanets has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past few decades. Between ground-based observatories and spacecraft like the Kepler mission, a total of 3,726 exoplanets have been confirmed in 2,792 systems, with 622 systems having more than one planet (as of Jan. 1st, 2018). And in the coming years, scientists expect that many more discoveries will be possible thanks to the deployment of next-generation missions.

These include NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and several next-generation ground based observatories. With their advanced instruments, these and other observatories are not only expected to find many more exoplanets, but to reveal new and fascinating things about them. For instance, a recent study from Columbia University indicated that it will be possible, using the Transit Method, to study surface elevations on exoplanets.

The study, which recently appeared online under the title “Finding Mountains with Molehills: The Detectability of Exotopography“, was conducted by Moiya McTier and David Kipping – and graduate student and an Assistant Professor of Astronomy at Columbia University, respectively. Based on models they created using bodies in our Solar System, the team considered whether transit surveys might be able to reveal topographical data on exoplanets.

To recap, the Transit Method (aka. Transit Photometry) is currently the most popular and reliable means for detecting exoplanets. It consists of astronomers measuring the light curve of distant stars over time and looking for periodic dips in brightness. These dips are the result of exoplanets passing in front of the star (i.e. transiting) relative to the observer.

By measuring the rate at which the star’s light dips, and the period with which the dimming occurs, astronomer are not only able to determine the presence of exoplanets, but also place accurate constraints on their size and orbital periods. According to McTier and Kipping, this same method could also reveal the presence of geographical features – for instance, mountain ranges, volcanoes, trenches, and craters.

As they indicate in their study, in lieu of direct imaging, indirect methods are the only means astronomers have for revealing data on an exoplanet’s surface. Unfortunately, there is no conceivable way that the radial velocity, microlensing, astrometry, and timing methods could reveal exotopography. This leaves the transit method, which has some potential in this respect. As they state:

“The transit method directly measures the sky-projected area of a planet’s silhouette relative to that of a star, under the assumption that the planet is not luminous itself… This fact implies that there is indeed some potential for transits to reveal surface features, since the planet’s silhouette is certainly distorted from a circular profile due to the presence of topography.”

In other words, as a planet transits in front of its host star, the light passing around the planet itself could be measured for small variations. These could indicate the presence of mountain ranges and other large-scale features like massive chasms. To test this theory, they considered planets in the Solar System as templates for how the scattering of light during a transit could reveal large-scale features.

As an example, they consider what an Earth analog planet would reveal if the Himalayan mountain range ran from north to south and was wide enough to span 1° in longitude:

“Now assume that the planet completes half of one rotation as it transits its parent star from our point of view, which is all that is necessary to see all of the planet’s features appear on its silhouette without repeating. As our hypothetical planet rotates and the Himalayan block moves into and out of view, the change in silhouette will result in different transit depths…”

Ultimately, they consider that Mars would be the ideal test case due to its combination of small size, low surface gravity, and active internal volcanism, which has caused it become what they describe as the “bumpiest body in the Solar System”. When paired with a white dwarf star, this presents the optimal case for using light curves to determine exotopography.

At a distance of about 0.01 AU (which would be within a white dwarf’s habitable zone), they calculate that a Mars-sized planet would have an orbital period of 11.3 hours. This would allow for many transits to be observed in a relatively short viewing period, thus ensuring a greater degree of accuracy. At the same time, the team admits that their proposed methods suffers from drawbacks.

For instance, due to the presence of astrophysical and instrumental noise, they determined that their method would be unproductive when it comes to studying exoplanets around Sun-like stars and M-type (red dwarf) stars. But for Mars-like planets orbiting low mass, white dwarf stars, the method could produce some highly valuable scientific returns.

While this might sound rather limited, it would present some rather fascinating opportunities to learn more about planets beyond our Solar System. As they explain:

“Finding the first evidence of mountains on planets outside our solar system would be exciting in its own right, but we can also infer planet characteristics from the presence and distribution of surface features. For example, a detection of bumpiness could lead to constraints on a planet’s internal processes.”

In short, planets with a high degree of bumpiness would indicate tectonic activity or the buildup of lava caused by internal heating sources. Those with the highest bumpiness (i.e. like Mars) would indicate that they too experience a combination internal processes, low surface gravity, volcanism, and a lack of tectonic plate movement. Meanwhile, low-bumpiness planets are less likely to have any of these internal processes and their surfaces are more likely to be shaped by external factors – like asteroid bombardment.

Based on their estimates, they conclude that the various super telescopes that are scheduled to be commissioned in the coming years would be up to task. These include the ESO’s OverWhelmingly Large (OWL) Telescope, a 100-meter proposed optical and near-infrared telescope that would build on the success of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).

Another example is the Colossus Telescope, a 74-meter optical and infrared telescope that is currently being commissioned by an international consortium. Once operational, it will be the largest telescope optimized for detecting extrasolar life and extraterrestrial civilizations.

In the past, the success of exoplanet hunters has come down to a combination of factors. In addition to greater levels of cooperation between institutions, amateur astronomers and citizen scientists, there has also been the way in which improved technology has coincided with new theoretical models. As more data become available, scientists are able to produce more educated estimates on what we might be able to learn once new instruments come online.

When the next-generation telescopes take to space or are finished construction here on Earth, we can anticipate that thousands more exoplanets will be found. At the same time, we can anticipate that important details will be also discovered about these planets that were not possible before. Do they have atmospheres? Do they have oceans? Do they have mountain ranges and chasms? We hope to find out!

Nevertheless, United paid £36million up front for the France international, with £22m available in add-ons and bonuses.

And Wenger conceded he didn’t expect the winger, who has started up front since his move to Old Trafford, to complete a summer transfer. “He was more a winger in his (early) career,” Wenger said. “And he played the final part of the season last year as striker.

Company executives conceded that the FTX, with a pugnacious grille wearing a thick crown of chrome, hints at the size and look of their next-generation Tundra, to begin production in 2006. Until this year, when Toyota introduced its larger-all-around Tundra Double Cab, its largest pickup fell short of rivals from Detroit's Big Three.

To the Editor:

''City Police Spied Broadly Before G.O.P. Convention'' (front page, March 25) sent a shudder through us and revived the feelings of frustration and anxiety that we experienced during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.

The sight of scores of police officers in riot gear on their new motorcycles with plastic handcuffs dangling from their uniforms, all to the soundtrack of constant surveillance helicopters, was reminiscent of a South American military regime.

We are law-abiding citizens. The police were empowered to treat us as potential rioters while we peacefully protested the policies of a president who now has a 28 percent approval rating.

Our city leaders will say they were looking out for our safety, but we never felt more vulnerable and afraid.

Re ''The Police and the Spy Unit'' (editorial, March 27):

You are to be congratulated for explaining that the police surveillance of political protesters during the Republican National Convention in 2004 posed a threat to the rights of speech, assembly and association guaranteed by the First Amendment and had nothing to do with law enforcement -- a point further reinforced by the fact that there were very few convictions for crimes or violations arising out of those almost 2,000 arrests.

The real motivation for the arrests and detentions of protesters, sometimes for several days in the city's filthy Pier 57, was political and unrelated to the protection of the public.

The Police Department has every right to spy and conduct surveillance on suspected criminals and miscreants before they have a chance to wreak havoc on the citizens of New York. The headline of your March 25 front-page article, ''City Police Spied Broadly Before G.O.P. Convention,'' and the gist of it make it seem as if the New York Police Department did something wrong; it did not!

You are out of touch with reality: most Americans, including New Yorkers, want to live and prosper in a society free from terror and violence. We are thankful that agencies like the N.Y.P.D. take offensive actions to keep us as safe as possible.

To the Editor:

I was struck by the dry statement that ''many of the 1,806 people arrested during the convention were held for up to two days on minor offenses normally handled with a summons.''

My daughter was among those arrested. She and the people she was with asked each police officer they passed whether he had any objection to their peacefully walking down the street and were reassured that there was no problem. They were herded into a trap surrounded by police officers (some embarrassed and apologetic).

They were taken to a warehouse. The only water was one toilet and one water fountain. They were left chained together in groups overnight, sleeping without pads or blankets.

Many developed rashes and other allergic reactions. Those whose medications had been confiscated started to become ill. The next day, they were taken to another holding pen, where they again spent the night heaped on a jail floor. They were held for three days and released only when the convention was ending, told that they could cause no more trouble.

It appears that this reaction was meant to convey that you will be risking your life the next time you attend a peaceful demonstration. Civil rights lawyers sued the city, and most of the original cases were thrown out on technicalities.

Re ''City Asks Court Not to Unseal Police Spy Files'' (news article, March 26):

As someone who participated in the 2004 protests, I believe that the claim by the city's lawyers that releasing documentation of the Police Department's appalling violations of our basic rights would harm the city's defense against lawsuits by those arrested comes very near to being an admission of wrongdoing.

In an Orwellian society, the fact that the truth would hurt the authorities is indeed a reason not to release it, but in a genuine democracy, the opposite is true.

Whether the authorities are held fully accountable for their illegal and antidemocratic behavior will indicate which system of government we live under.

To the Editor:

The Police Department had every right to be concerned about violence at the Republican National Convention. Many of the groups, allegedly devoted to free speech and ''open-mindedness,'' had blatantly stated that it was their intention to disrupt the proceedings and to intimidate the delegates into leaving town. And this is exactly what the anti-Republican protesters almost succeeded in doing.

The N.Y.P.D. had only to look at the mayhem created by the ''peace'' activists during the World Trade Organization summit meeting in 1999 in Seattle, where the police sat on their hands and let anarchists engage in destruction, to realize that they needed to quickly identify and deter activists before they were in a position to stop the Republican convention.

If it had been the Democratic convention that was disrupted by an alliance of right-wing groups, The Times would no doubt be screaming that the police were too passive in seeking out violent protesters.

An attorney general obfuscates the truth and fails to uphold the Constitution. Police departments spy on citizens, and candidates of both parties pontificate about how they will improve ''the system.'' Did I fall asleep and miss the last three decades?

How did I get to be in my 60s? And my adult children want to know why I don't have faith in our electoral system!

Vice President Mike Pence is getting a warm reception in Israel this week, in part because he brings news that the move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is ahead of schedule. “Jerusalem is Israel’s capital,” Pence said in a speech before the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. “In the weeks ahead, our administration will advance its plan to open the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem—and the embassy will open by the end of next year.” The vice president visited Egypt and Jordan before landing in Israel on Sunday evening. On Monday, he had dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem on Tuesday.

Pro-Life Democrats? At a pro-life event in Chicago last week, Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski spoke. He was the only Democrat to do so. When the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act passed the House of Representatives on Friday by a vote of 241-183, only six Democrats – including Lipinski – voted for the bill. It’s tough to be a pro-life Democrat, and it’s getting tougher. Lipinski, a seven-term congressman, is getting serious primary opposition this year. In a rare move, two members of the Illinois delegation have already endorsed Lipinski’s primary opponent. A poll released last week says that about 25 percent of Democrats are pro-life, but you sure can’t tell that by looking at the policies of the party.

Remembering Lance Sijan. Lance Sijan died 50 years ago this week, on Jan. 22, 1968. His name is not well known to most Americans, but Air Force Academy graduates must commit his story to memory, as he is the only USAFA graduate so far to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. In late 1967 his F-4 was shot down over Vietnam. Sijan was badly wounded but nonetheless evaded capture for 46 days before being taken prisoner. Following brutal torture, escape and recapture, and other remarkable acts of courage and heroism, Sijan died in captivity. He was 25 years old. Sijan was posthumously promoted to captain. In 1976, President Ford presented his family with his Medal of Honor. At the Captain Lance P. Sijan Plaza in his hometown of Milwaukee is a monument with these words from the Christian apologist G.K. Chesterton: “The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.” You can read more of his story here.

To Spank or Not to Spank. Singer Kelly Clarkson attracted a firestorm of media attention when she said she occasionally spanked her 3-year-old daughter. This celebrity news was often paired in the media with a recent study from the University of Texas saying spanking is bad for kids. Most Americans, though, are siding with Clarkson. The General Social Study found that two-thirds of Americans agree with the statement, “It is sometimes necessary to discipline a child with a good, hard spanking.” According to WORLD, “Spanking is legal in all 50 states. Some states have restrictions on how parents can spank, and some states have outlawed spanking in schools, but no state has completely banned spanking at home.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Pence in Israel, Pro-Life Democrats, Remembering Lance Sijan, and To Spank or Not To Spank?","Warren Cole Smith, John Stonestreet, Roberto Rivera, Eric Metaxas",,[''],Warren Cole Smith looks at the headlines from Christian worldview perspective,"Mike Pence, Israel, Lance Sijan, Democratic Party, Abortion",,

''We had a scout in Europe who saw him pitch in Italy. He said, 'Doug, I think this guy could pitch in the big leagues.' When you get those phone calls, you say, sure, there's a guy in Italy.''

The tip the Cardinals received about Simontacchi came from a not-so-distant land.

''He was recommended to us by Dave LaPoint, who coached him in winter ball, and Enrique Brito, our Venezuelan scout, who saw him in winter ball,'' Walt Jocketty, the Cardinals' general manager, said.

Trying to become a major leaguer at 28, Simontacchi caught the Cardinals' attention in spring training, Jocketty said, by striking out Brian Jordan in an otherwise meaningless exhibition encounter. He then impressed the Cardinals' minor league people, and when St. Louis starting pitchers started going down, they called Simontacchi up.

''He's staying up, for now,'' Jocketty said. ''It's hard not to give him the ball.''

In three starts, Simontacchi has a 2-0 record and a 2.37 earned run average. Lopez has a 5-0 record and a 1.94 E.R.A. in six starts and five relief appearances. He joined the rotation a month ago.

Syd Thrift, the Orioles' vice president for baseball operations, said the team first noticed Lopez when he pitched briefly for the San Diego Padres in 2000. The Orioles followed him after that and received good reports on his work in the 2001-2 Mexican winter league.

''Oscar Suarez, who has been a player agent and a friend for years, told me how well he was pitching,'' Thrift said, ''so we signed him based on his and other recommendations. After we signed him he started pitching better. They won the Caribbean World Series and he won two games, including the final game. He came to spring training and took off.''

Derek Lowe of Boston took off this season. He has pitched in the majors longer than these relative newcomers, but nothing he did previously as a reliever offered a hint of what was to come this season. He is 7-2 with a 2.12 E.R.A. after allowing three runs in six innings of a 3-2 loss to the Yankees yesterday.

Vicente Padilla of Philadelphia has a 6-3 record and 2.57 E.R.A. Chris Reitsma of Cincinnati is 3-0, 2.59; Josh Fogg of Pittsburgh 5-2, 2.75; Joel Pineiro of Seattle 4-1, 2.00; Roy Oswalt of Houston 5-2, 2.22; Carlos Hernandez of Houston 4-2, 3.38; Roy Halladay of Toronto 5-1, 3.15; Ryan Jensen of San Francisco 4-3, 3.06; Brian Lawrence of San Diego 4-3, 3.19.

Damian Moss of Atlanta has only a 1-1 record but a 2.54 E.R.A. in eight starts and one relief outing. Dennis Stark, a 27-year-old rookie with Colorado, has won his first three starts and has a 1.50 E.R.A.

''There are guys who have come on and done a great job this year, especially in the National League,'' Dan Evans, the Dodgers' general manager, said. ''There seems to be an abundance of real solid young pitching.''

Evans has had a good view of some of that pitching, especially from Ishii, who has reeled off a 7-1 record and a 2.77 E.R.A. in his debut season.

''Our scouts felt he would come in and make an immediate impact on our club,'' Evans said. ''I've been impressed with his ability to alter his game plan and his mechanics within a ball game. Very few guys can do that. Most guys need a day on the side to do that. He corrects himself in a game. There have been three or four games where he's pitched out of the stretch in the middle innings of a game to eliminate a flaw from his delivery in the windup. That shows a real understanding of himself.''

The Chicago Cubs are certain they have a young pitcher who will be a member in good standing of this group. Mark Prior made his first start last week and gained his first victory with six strong innings.

''The time may come,'' the Cardinals' Jocketty said, ''where these guys get through the league another time or two and something catches up with them, but there's been no indication that that's going to change.''

Dodgers' New Look

The Dodgers, in one development with their pitching, have already surpassed their efforts of last season. Left-handers have started 20 of their games.

''We had four starts by left-handers last year,'' Dan Evans said, ''three by Terry Mulholland, one by Jeff Williams, and they were all really emergency starts. We had five right-handers, and it didn't give us a real good shot in a series because all of the starters had similar game plans. By the third or fourth game of a series, the hitters had an idea of what to expect.''

Odalis Perez, whom the Dodgers acquired from Atlanta in the Gary Sheffield trade, has started 10 games. Kazuhisa Ishii, their new Japanese pitcher, has started eight. Omar Daal, obtained from Philadelphia, made two starts when Kevin Brown was hurt.

The Indians' Decline

The Chicago White Sox scored 12 runs against Detroit on Friday night. It was their 10th time in double digits this season, most in the majors.

''The White Sox lineup is so deep, it gives me a feeling for what it must have been like to play us from 1994 through last season,'' Mark Shapiro, the Cleveland Indians' general manager, said.

The Indians' awesome offense of Albert Belle, Manny Ramirez, Jim Thome, Kenny Lofton and assorted friends are a memory. So are the 11 victories in the first 12 games achieved by this season's team. These Indians have scored three or fewer runs in 26 of 35 games. They lost 24 of the 35 games. These Indians will be hard pressed to win the division championship.

''The greatest challenge in evaluating our club,'' Shapiro said, ''has been the extreme of those 12 games. The greater reality is probably in the games since.''

Shapiro is not prepared to give up on the season just yet.

''One reason I hesitate to give up hope for our club is our division,'' he said. ''No one has run away with it. Second, what we believe to be our strength, our pitching, especially our young pitching, has been better than we hoped. We feel these guys are only going to get better as the year goes along and they develop. That's a plus. A negative is our ability to score runs. It's a greater challenge than we ever imagined.''

At some point the Indians will have to decide whether they can be a viable season-long contender or if they would be better off trading some of their higher-priced players for good prospects and rebuilding for another extended run.

Tightening the Belt

When Tom Hicks, owner of the Rangers, soared $100 million above the next highest offer Alex Rodriguez received and signed him to a $252 million contract, he shrugged off suggestions that he was overpaying. It was a business deal, Hicks explained, one that worked for the Rangers.

Now Hicks says he expects the Rangers to lose $20 million this year and doesn't plan for that to happen again. ''We're going to start playing within our means,'' he said.

2519,9681857.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/business/economy/economic-recovery-spreads-to-the-middle-class-.html,"On Tuesday and Wednesday, Fed policy makers will hold their final meeting of the year, followed by a news conference from Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, where she is expected to provide further hints about when the Fed will begin raising short-term interest rates after keeping them near zero for the last six years.

The nascent uptick in wages has prompted further warnings from the more hawkish members of the Fed’s policy-making council who want the central bank to start tightening monetary policy sooner, rather than later, to ward off what they see as a potential threat of inflation.

But Ms. Yellen and a majority of Fed policy makers, pointing to evidence that inflation remains well under the central bank’s 2 percent target, do not appear to be unduly alarmed and probably still prefer to leave interest rates as low as possible until the trend is better established.

“Until it is unambiguous, people can spin it any way they want,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “One month is a curiosity, two months is interesting and three months is a trend.”

The split at the Fed is echoed in Washington, primarily along partisan lines. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans say it is time for the Fed to act, while Democrats in the Obama administration, like Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, say there is no rush.

“I welcome the point when my first concern when I get out of bed in the morning is having to address rapid wage growth,” Mr. Perez said. “I’m not too worried about inflation.”

As for the argument that the Fed needs to move sooner, rather than later, Mr. Perez said he “couldn’t reject that in stronger terms.”

“It’s time for the middle class and the aspiring middle class to share in the dividends of their hard work,” he added. “The folks at the top end have been doing great and our prosperity hasn’t been shared.”

By contrast, Representative Kevin P. Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has called on the Fed to move quickly, but even some conservative economists say the plunge in energy prices gives the central bank more flexibility this time around.

“Historically, inflation is something that gets out of the box because the Fed moves too slowly,” said Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Fed economist. “But we’ve had a positive energy shock, so the Fed has ample room to wait and see.”

In just the last month, average gasoline prices have dropped by 25 cents, to $2.77 a gallon nationally, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, and more reductions are on the way as crude oil prices continue to fall.

And if wages keep rising, the typical American family will have a couple of thousand more dollars to spend in 2015.

Extended over the next year, November’s 0.4 percent increase in average hourly earnings would equal an annual wage increase of nearly 5 percent, more than double the 2.1 percent increase recorded over the last 12 months.

“If the average is 2 percent, there are a lot of people getting next to nothing,” Mr. Shepherdson said. “And 2 percent wage growth when corporate profits are skyrocketing makes people very angry.”

But before anyone strikes up “Happy Days Are Here Again,” Mr. Shepherdson cautioned that a previous 0.4 percent rise in wages in June 2013 was followed by no increase the next month. Similarly, the 0.4 percent gain in October 2011 also showed no signs of staying power.

What might be different this time, Mr. Shepherdson said, is that the rise in average hourly earnings coincides with other positive data, including a fall in jobless claims, a declining unemployment rate and healthy hiring by private employers, as well as an increase in job openings.

On Monday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States rose by 1.1 percent in November, and also revised upward the increase for October. Over all, the new data shows factory output in the United States has finally exceeded its prerecession level.

Despite the positive data recently, Fed policy makers have made clear that they won’t act on rates this week, or at their next meeting in January, but rather wait at least until March and more likely June 2015, at the earliest, economists said.

One possible development on Wednesday, when policy makers wrap up their meeting, is that the Fed will tweak the language in its policy statement and drop its reference to keep rates near zero “for a considerable time.”

Although optimists like Mr. Shepherdson and Mr. Behravesh say the wage gains should become broader as unemployment continues to fall, professionals on the front lines of the labor market say higher-paid, better-educated workers with specialized skills are still getting the greater share of raises right now.

“What people want to see is 1999 or 2004, when companies were saying, ‘We’ll hire anyone,’ ” said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. “That’s not what’s happening now.”

Instead, Mr. Gimbel said, salaries are rising in sectors in which experienced workers are harder to find, like technology, finance and higher-level accounting positions, and where salaries tend to be at least $80,000 or more.

For recent college graduates with liberal arts degrees, or workers in call centers and in data processing jobs, where yearly wages are less than $50,000, Mr. Gimbel said, “we’re bringing people in at the same salary as 10 years ago.”

Mr. Gimbel added that new college graduates were still willing to take jobs they might have rejected in the past, like working in a call center.

“They figure, “The sooner I get a job, the quicker I can start paying off a mountain of student debt,’ ” he said. “And for guys working as a lifeguard or in the gym, a call center is white-collar experience.”",2018-02-11 00:47:59.678084,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Economic Recovery Spreads to the Middle Class ,Nelson D.

Apparently they do. I asked the owner of Chantecaille, a brand that sells products like a Nano Gold Energizing Cream ($420 for 1.7 ounces at Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman), what customers typically ask before they buy.

“They want to know if it’s toxic,” Sylvie Chantecaille, the owner, said by telephone. “The second thing they want to know is what form it is, what is with it and exactly what it’s going to do.”

When cosmetics executives describe the purported benefits of gold for the skin, they seem to be reading from the same PowerPoint slide: anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti- acne . People who sell creams with visible gold flecks talk about the ability of those flecks to warm the skin and make it conducive to other ingredients. People who sell gold in nano form — that is, in microscopic particles suspended in a liquid mixture known as a colloid — look down on this crowd, saying that gold can confer benefits only when it is broken down small enough to penetrate the skin.

“Gold flecks won’t do anything to your skin other than make it look pretty,” said Laura DeLuisa LaRocca, founder of LaRocca Skincare, which sells a line of modestly priced products with gold in them (like 24K Gold Active Vitamin Repair Mist, $29 for 1.7 ounces). “Colloidal gold is the best option when you’re using gold.”

“I’ve been using it for two years, and it definitely has changed my skin,” Ms. LaRocca said of her line. “It has tightened it, it has toned it, my lines have faded probably 40 percent.”

But is it true that gold has therapeutic qualities? That depends if you ask someone who is selling it suspended in cream or someone who went to medical school. Dermatologists speak with one voice, saying that gold cannot help you, but it absolutely can hurt you, causing inflammatory reactions like contact dermatitis (which may be what happened to me). In high doses, gold can be toxic, but these products probably don’t contain enough of it to make that happen, doctors say.

Dr. Judith Hellman, a dermatologist in New York City , did research into gold face creams after enough magazine beauty editors pestered her about them. “At best, they do nothing, and at worst, they can give you irritation of the skin,” she said. “I would tell people to put that money into gold that they can wear around their neck or on their fingers.”

Dr. Jeannette Graf, a dermatologist in Great Neck, N.Y., went further, saying she had done “intensive medical searches on this very ingredient” and found that “there are absolutely no scientific studies that show that gold has any effect in firming or revitalizing the skin, nor that it reduces wrinkles or gives skin a plumped, golden glow.” (She has her own skin care line — with no gold in it — sold on HSN.)

But Dr. Graf did find that gold was named “allergen of the year” in 2001 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.

The skin care companies tend to counter these statements by saying that they have proprietary research showing the benefits of gold. Over at La Prairie, which sells three products with colloidal gold, Holly Genovese, a vice president, said that the company’s scientists had found a way to use gold that is valuable to the skin.

“Colloidal gold does help to maintain your skin’s elasticity and firmness,” she said. “Gold itself is known to have very soothing benefits to it.”

When La Prairie’s Cellular Radiance Concentrate Pure Gold ($580 an ounce) was introduced in 2006, it was “the first big, major introduction of any major cosmetic company using gold in a skin care product,” Ms. Genovese said. The product, which she described as “a multitasking serum for the face,” has been “a huge hit for us,” she said.

La Prairie has just come out with a line of products that contain colloidal platinum — including a cream that costs $1,000 an ounce — and plans this fall to introduce a gold-infused sunscreen/moisturizer that will cost $425 for 1.7 ounces. “Our customers are waiting with bated breath,” Ms. Genovese said.

Gold is certainly an “it” color this year, on everything from gladiator sandals to slouchy handbags to eye shadow. And the price of gold may have something to do with it: it has been fetching record prices, in the vicinity of $1,200 an ounce, in the commodities market.

While that does give cosmetics companies an easy reason to jack up prices, not all products that contain gold are wildly expensive. At one end of the spectrum is La Prairie. At the other is the Christine Valmy mask that I tried, which costs $13.50 for one application.

Another line is Oro Gold, whose manufacturer, Mazal Enterprise, boasts that its products contain both nano gold and gold flakes. In a telephone interview, Keren Ballard, a marketing executive for Oro Gold, outlined a number of benefits: gold, she said, is hypoallergenic, stimulates blood circulation, reduces sunspots and acts as an antioxidant.

“The gold actually acts like a small charger, because it’s metal and we have electricity in our bodies,” she said. “Whenever gold comes into contact with our bodies, it gives a boost of activity, which is good for restoring the lost elasticity properties of the tissue.” I asked whether wearing gold jewelry had the same effect. “It will work only on the specific area you’re wearing the jewelry,” Ms. Ballard said. “It will not recharge the cells. The gold would have to penetrate the skin to do that.”

In marketing materials, companies that sell gold creams are far more circumspect. The Food and Drug Administration does not recognize gold as an active ingredient, though it is recognized as a colorant by the Personal Care Products Council, a trade association.

At Dyanna Spa, a body and nail salon in Manhattan , the owners let me look at a package of the powder used to create the signature mask in their 24KT Gold Mask Facial. The active ingredients of the mask, made by a company called Farah, are listed as sugar (which the package said “regulates skin movements”), gold pigments (“provides shine”) and betaine (“moisturizer”).

The spa, which also offers facials with caviar, recommends the gold one for older clients. The use of gold as a beauty treatment “goes back to Chinese history and Cleopatra,” said Mona Winograd, an owner of Dyanna Spa.

Indeed, Cleopatra was cited by nearly everyone I spoke to who sells skin care products with gold in them. We all know that she looked exactly like the young Elizabeth Taylor , but is it true that she used gold on her face as a beauty ritual?

Probably not, said Duane W. Roller, a retired classics professor who just published a biography of Cleopatra. Although she did wear plenty of gold jewelry, he said, there is no reference to her using gold as a face cream. “I don’t think we have anything in the sources that tell us about what we might loosely call makeup,” he said.

Cosmetics makers also habitually cite the use of gold in medicine, where it is given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been used — only experimentally — as a possible cancer treatment. Debabrata Mukhopadhyay, a professor and cancer researcher at the Mayo Clinic , said that while gold nanoparticles show promise, they are “highly toxic when injected in high doses in mice.” And the size of the nanoparticles matters a lot, he said, adding that it was unclear if the particles in the gold face creams were the right size to penetrate the skin.

“As a scientist, I am very skeptical unless I see research,” he said.

Mostafa El-Sayed, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is also an expert in the field, said it was ridiculous to think that gold could fight wrinkles because of its use in cancer research. “The way it takes care of cancer, the nanoparticle goes only to cancer cells, none of the healthy cells,” he said.

But try telling that to all those satisfied La Prairie customers. Ms. Genovese pointed out that people keep buying her company’s gold line because they perceive that it works. “These products do more than just make a promise, they deliver on that promise,” she said. “In one study that was done a year go, one client said, ‘Look, next to the mortgage payment comes La Prairie.’ ”

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said there are ""no known threats"" north of the Border despite the rise in attacks across Europe. ACC Johnson, head of Police Scotland's Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism unit, added: ""While we want people to be alive to the risks and threats, there is no cause for people to feel directly alarmed. ""There is no known threat to the people of Scotland at this time, and we will work hard to maintain that position."" His comments followed a warning from Britain's top policeman warned yesterday that it is just a matter of time before terrorists succeed in carrying out a major attack in the country.





Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: ""You could say it is a case of when, not if."" He admitted that the spate of terror attacks on the Continent made it feel like ""dark and desperate times"". But Britain has ""world-beating"" security services and is protected by its gun controls and the fact that it is an island, he said. Sir Bernard said Britain's tolerance and defiance meant terrorists ""will never win"".

GETTY Despite the lower threat Scottish police still remain vigilant

There is no known threat to the people of Scotland at this time Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson

""Yes, these can feel like dark and desperate times. But defeating terrorism is as much about refusing to be afraid as anything else, refusing to change our beliefs, our values and way of life. ""We will not become like them. We will not hate. We will not be cowed. And because of this they will never win."" Sir Bernard is the latest security chief to warn of the inevitability of an attack. Last September MI5 boss Andrew Parker said the terror threat was at its highest in the 32 years he had been in the service. And in January last year he said the security services ""cannot hope to stop"" every plot. Europe has been rocked by Islamic State attacks over the past year and a half.

GETTY Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said it's not an if but when the terror attacks will occur

They include the murder of 130 in Paris last November, 32 in Brussels in March, another 84 in Nice earlier this month and the slaying of an elderly priest last week. Sir Bernard said: ""I know with each new outrage, and especially those on our doorstep on the Continent, there is a greater sense of fear that Britain will be the next victim of mindless murder. ""As the police officer in charge of preventing such an attack, I know you want me to reassure you. ""I am afraid I cannot do that entirely. Our threat level has been at 'Severe' for two years. It remains there. It means an attack is highly likely - you could say it is a case of when, not if."" But he said Britain has not suffered a terrorist attack since soldier Lee Rigby was murdered by IS in 2013.

Koch. ''These guys produced movies from start to finish. Today, the world has changed. There are executive producers and line producers and co-producers and co-executive producers. There's all these titles.''

If anyone can be called a producer -- and recent history, they say, has shown that virtually anyone can -- then the title is diminished, the chain of command is degraded, and real producers gradually lose their position in the industry's pecking order.

''''Sometimes studios have a tough time holding the line,'' said the producer Laurence Mark, ''particularly when a negotiator can say, 'Look, rather than giving this guy X dollars, let's give him a producer credit.' A major director or a star, in extreme cases, can say, 'Oh, to do this movie I need to have a producer credit for my hairdresser.' Unfortunately, to the producers actually doing the job, it's a tad unseemly.''

The producer is the last remaining on-screen category for which the rules are so diffuse and the restrictions so loose that almost anyone can potentially negotiate a credit. Directors often take one, arguing that they were involved in the early development. Studio executives sometimes insist on one. Top-name actors and screenwriters sometimes get them, as do their managers, and, if the apocryphal tales are true, their drivers, hairdressers, assistants and relatives.

In the recent David Mamet comedy ''State and Main,'' one of the running gags is that the film-within-a-film's unscrupulous producers toss around associate producer credits like beads at Mardi Gras, in return for the slightest service.

Part of the problem is that there is no set job description for being a producer.

''It is frustrating,'' said Kathleen Kennedy, a three-time Oscar nominee and the recently named president of the Producers Guild of America, ''because it is a real job and absolutely essential to getting movies made.''

She added: ''But I'll bet I haven't worked on a single movie where, on the press day, I wasn't asked by several reporters to describe what I do. I remember Dick Zanuck telling me that right after walking off stage from winning the Oscar for producing 'Driving Miss Daisy,' the first question he got from a reporter was to describe what a producer does.''

The dilemma is that the old answer -- a producer does whatever needs doing to keep the project moving forward -- is just vague enough to open the door to stowaways and pretenders.

So a coalition of Hollywood's top producers, working under the umbrella of the Producers Guild, is making a concerted effort to crack down on bogus producing credits. Their plan is, first, to offer an on-screen, guild-sanctioned symbol (a Golden Laurel) to those producers who have proven to the guild's satisfaction that they have actually performed the functions of a producer and then, eventually, to provide the same kind of credit-arbitrating service for producers that the Writers Guild provides for writers.

''The problem is that there are a lot of different functions that a producer performs at different times during the creation and production of a film,'' said Vance Van Petten, the guild's executive director.

The guild assembled a roster of some of Hollywood's top producers and tried to boil down the essential duties that a producer performs. They came up with 40, beginning with the inception of a project, the development of its script and the hiring of a cast and director, and continuing through the raising of money, the decisions about whether to shoot on location or in a studio, the negotiating with vendors and crew members and the postproduction and marketing.

To qualify for a Golden Laurel -- limited to no more than three per film -- producers must show that they were involved in more than half of those 40 functions.

As anyone who has studied film credits knows, there are a variety of producer flavors -- the producer, the co-producer, the executive producer, the co-executive producer and the associate producer -- ostensibly denoting levels of accountability and authority. In reality, the lines between the groupings are fungible, and the specific duties required of each are cloudy at best.

''The problem is, it's the only credit on a film where you don't really have to have contributed anything or performed any specific function in order to receive it,'' said Gale Anne Hurd, who has been a top producer since ''The Terminator'' in 1984. ''That has developed because the studios perceive that it saves them money. They negotiate producing credit in lieu of more financial compensation.''

The Writers Guild, by agreement with the studios, is the ultimate authority on who gets screenplay credits. No director is going to allow a financier to share that credit. So the producer credit is left hanging out there on its own, the only credit whose quasi-management status is unprotected by a collective bargaining agreement and is thus vulnerable to being negotiated away.

Still, it's hard to feel too sorry for the Hollywood producer, widely seen as a stereotypical money man with a lavish estate in one of the tonier canyons and a beach house at Malibu. ''Yeah, the fat guy with the cigar who's holding the purse strings,'' Mr. Koch said. ''But that's just not true anymore.'' Not that the pay isn't good and the lifestyle plush, but cost-cutting resulting from the introduction of corporate thinking at the major movie studios in recent years has made producing a more precarious calling.

Mr. Van Petten has been leading the fight to ''stop credit fraud,'' as the guild calls it.

''I started out as a lawyer in private practice, representing producers and talent, and then I was head of business affairs at three studios, so that all gave me a particular perspective on the problem,'' Mr. Van Petten said. ''For much of the last 10 or 15 years, I was part of the problem. What's happened is that the business affairs departments at the studios have monetarized the producer credit. It became very common practice to give a producer credit in lieu of more money. We joked about it.''

When he moved to the guild in January of 2000, Mr. Van Petten said his first move was to sit down with as many top-name producers as he could and ask them what they thought of the problem. What he found, he said, was a simmering anger and a certain level of cynicism that anything would be done about it. The precipitating incident came in the mid-1990's, when in negotiations with writers the Hollywood studios agreed to move the screenplay credits right before (if opening credits) or right after (if tail credits) that of the director -- in other words, leap-frogging over the credits for producers.

''And this was done without anyone ever talking to the producers about it,'' Ms. Hurd said. ''It started a lot of people thinking that a producers' guild was definitely needed.''

(Another dispute over possibly false credits caused The Hollywood Reporter to put one of its popular columnists, George Christy, on hiatus last week while it investigated charges that he accepted bogus acting credits for films in which he did not appear so he would qualify for union health benefits.)

Producers by nature are independent and competitive, so some worried that they would ever come together in any cause.

''The first step of the process has been the hardest, gaining approval and legitimacy in our own community of producers,'' Mr. Van Petten said. ''We've won that war. Oh, there are still a few skirmishes with certain producers who won't want to be told what they can and cannot do with their credits, but they're seeing the light, too.''

The Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers, which represents the major studios and television networks, has already come to an agreement with the Producers Guild to support its effort to police producer credits. All that remains now, Mr. Van Petten said, is to conclude agreements with individual studios. To do that, he said, the guild will have to demonstrate its willingness to police its own ranks. Some opposition is to be expected as this effort accelerates, he said, mostly from managers, financiers and others accustomed to getting almost automatic producer credit on films involving their clients or their money.

''There are some who are just pigs and want everything,'' Mr. Van Petten said. ''But it's our belief that what has happened is that so many people have been coming from so far afield to demand producer credits that the studios have seen this backfire on them. We are hoping that, when it comes down to it, they will be happy to have someone take this off their hands.''

The main impetus, thus far, has been the guild's annual Golden Laurel Awards (the equivalent of the Directors Guild and Screen Actors Guild Awards). Only guild-accredited producers are eligible.

Not receiving a Producers Guild award is one thing, but the real clincher would be for bogus producers to be banned from receiving a gold statuette at the Academy Awards. And just such an effort is said to be under way. Normally, anyone listed as a full producer on a movie that wins best picture is given an Oscar. But although it has not yet been announced, several producers said the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was considering a rules change under which studio executives, talent managers and perhaps others who are named as producer on a film will be ineligible for an Oscar unless they can prove that they also actively worked on producing the film.

The Producers Guild is also pushing for wider use of the Golden Laurel symbol next to the name of accredited producers in film credits, similar to the A.S.C. that follows the names of cinematographers accredited by the American Society of Cinematographers. The guild is negotiating with studios over the use of the symbol and urging its members to demand it.

''You look at some of the people who get credit after credit,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''Nobody can produce eight movies in a year. It's a joke.''

''You know, it's a real job,'' he continued. ''It's got real responsibilities and real skills are involved. I mean, the people sitting out there in the audience watching all of these names roll by, they must be thinking, what in the heck do all these people do? The answer is, in too many cases: Nothing.''",2018-02-11 00:35:57.248510,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"Produced by . . .

By VCDL Member, Tony Johnson

Covington VA – -(Ammoland.com)- This is the account of the first time I was pulled over by a LEO while carrying concealed.

I had just finished making a night-drop deposit at the bank of about $$3,000 when I proceeded home around 11:45 pm. I lived in Pulaski County, VA at the time. I noticed the LEO's lights in the mirror and silently rebuffed myself for not having replaced my burned-out headlight. One very important aspect of an encounter with a LEO, especially at night, is to start things off properly, so I pulled into a well-lit public parking area, rolled down my window, turned on my dome light, turned off my engine and remaining headlight, and kept my hands on the top of the steering wheel in plain view.

He approached my car and asked me if I knew why he had pulled me over. I responded that it probably was the headlight I had not replaced as I had worked overtime that weekend. He said I was correct and asked to see my license and registration. At that point I politely responded “Officer, before I do that I want to inform you that I am a CHP holder and am currently armed with a 9mm on my person.”

I was carrying IWB. He politely asked me if I would open the door from the outside and step out of the car. Note: never reach back inside the car if a LEO suspects or knows you are armed. Why add tension to the situation? I reached through my own window and opened the door from the outside and stepped out of the car keeping my hands on the very top of the door in plain view. He asked me where my firearm and wallet were, and I told him I was carrying IWB in front on the left side and my wallet was in my left rear pocket.

He asked me to show my firearm so I slowly moved my left hand and lifted that side of my shirt by grabbing my shirt near the top. Do not lift it from the bottom as that puts your hand very close to your firearm. The LEO removed my firearm and placed it on the rear of the car, he also removed my wallet and handed it to me. I removed my license and CHP and handed them to him. He took my firearm with him to run my license. He returned and handed me back my license and CHP which I put back in my wallet and laid it on top of the car (again, no hands on the body).

The LEO removed the magazine from my firearm and handed it to me. He ejected the round that was in the chamber (I carry with one in the pipe). The round ejected and fell at his feet. I politely asked him if he would like for me to pick the round up for him and he said he would. I did so and held it in my hand. He complimented my firearm, as it is one of the smallest 9mm's available today, and we continued to chat for several minutes about its performance, cost, etc.

He was very friendly, and didn't give me a ticket either. The main thing that made this a polite encounter rather than a disaster is the fact that I took most of the stress out of his experience. My step-dad is a retired Virginia State Police officer, and I have other friends and family that are or were LEO's. When a LEO stops a vehicle he or she is literally placing themselves in the position of being a potential target.

Encounters with LEO's are not the time to hold a 2-A protest. Most of them are just doing their jobs and want to go home to their families alive at the end of the day like the rest of us. In addition, every LEO that I have asked said that he or she wished law-abiding people carried concealed. If we understand encounters with LEO's to be what they are (i.e. somebody just doing their job) and not what they aren't (i.e. personal insults or attacks against us as individuals) we can all go home to our families alive at the end of the day.

Release The Memo at the State of the Union address



The undercover sabotage and FBI gamesmanship during 2016’s presidential campaign runs much deeper than the “Secret Society” that threw in with the Clinton campaign to fund a discredited dirty dossier used to justify the FISA warrants allowing the Obama administration to spy on the Trump campaign—right from the White House. Peter Strzok and his mistress Lisa Page, are the two top FBI officials “directly involved in Hillary Clinton’s exoneration, the Russian dossier, the phony collusion investigation, the “secret society,” and the “insurance policy.” (News.com.au)

Yet other than in stories of the recent “Secret Society” revelation, Strzok mistress Page has absolutely no presence to speak of on the Internet. Google it and see for yourself that Page has no Wikipedia entry and were it not for her association with Strzok, would likely have remained an online unknown. How is this even possible for a “top FBI official” who was dragged out into the public forum for her participation in a “secret society” that came up with an “insurance policy” seeking to get rid of Donald Trump should he ever be elected? Not only is Page well hidden behind an Internet wall, worse still, it has just come out that the agency for which she works has somehow managed to “disappear” five months’ worth of texts between she and her lover Peter Strzok. How appropriate was it for two agents engaged in an extra marital affair to have helped pass on the Fusion GPS dirty dossier centred on the “golden shower” to the special counsel probing the Russian collusion scandal? The four-page ‘classified’ document said to contain jaw-dropping details about how the FBI goes about its surveillance these days should be released—pronto.

These were not just big-talking bloggers who worked out an “insurance policy” against the president of the United States, but seasoned, highly-placed FBI agents. What good is a document that unearths the truth—no matter how frightening—if the first rule of the memo is that you can’t talk about the memo? The “secret memo” was written by staffers for Republican Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Out with it, Devin Nunes unless you were planning to have it first titillate the masses before having it mothballed. “The four-page document is said to contain claims federal officials abused a US surveillance program to target and undermine the Trump campaign. Three people who viewed the document told Politico it raises questions about how the FBI handled a decision to surveil Trump adviser Carter Page, and whether the infamous “golden shower” Steele dossier played a role in the decision. (news.com.au) Golden Shower author Christopher Steele is MIA, main players Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama suddenly gone Mum, yet the discredited dossier they circulated is still doing the rounds, and their FBI-mounted Big Nothing-burger called “The-Russians-stole-the-election” conspiracy incredibly still out there, too. Chair of a group that is holding closed-door hearings on Russian interference in the 2016 elections, Nunes has already interviewed high level Trump staffers like Steve Bannon, and communications director Hope Hicks is due to be quizzed on Friday.

Continued below... How about grilling Strzok and Page? How about grilling Strzok and Page? Meanwhile, while Robert Mueller pal Jim Comey is teaching a college course on Ethics and quoting himself on Twitter, #releasethememo and #findthetexts are trending online. If the memo is not released by January 30th, President Trump should take up Jack Posobiec’s suggestion in today’s Tweet: At the State of the Union, Trump should walk up and say, “I had a big speech all planned but instead I’ve decided to read out this four page memo…” — Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) January 25, 2018

I use and maintain both PC's and Macs, and when I upgrade one of my Macs, I allow an hour and rarely need more. For PC's, I have learned through bitter experience to schedule a day or two.

Those of us fortunate enough to own Macs have very simple upgrade paths; for example, Mac processors have come on easily replaceable cards since the late 1990's. Want a faster processor? Just order one from one of several Mac upgrade card companies, drop it in, and it works.

“THE SON OF A CUBAN IMMIGRANT”

by Sharon Rondeau, h/t Reader

(May 27, 2015) — Because of his physical birth in Canada, presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz was born a citizen of that country. Cruz claims to have also been born a U.S. citizen and thereby maintains that he is a “natural born Citizen” eligible to seek the presidency under Article II, Section 1, clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution.

The “natural born Citizen” clause in the Constitution appears to have been included to preclude foreign influence over the chief executive of the nation. Various statements, commentaries and U.S. Supreme Court case opinions have referred to a “natural born Citizen” as having been born in the U.S. to citizen parents.

According to The Dallas Morning News’s Todd J. Gillman, Cruz’s campaign is relying on commentary issued by former Solicitors General Paul Clement and Neal Katyal, who respectively worked in politically-divergent administrations and maintain that Cruz, by virtue of his birth to a US-citizen mother, is a “natural born Citizen.”

In closing their article at the Harvard Law Review published a week before Cruz declared himself a candidate, Katyal and Clement wrote, “…as Congress has recognized since the Founding, a person born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent is generally a U.S. citizen from birth with no need for naturalization. And the phrase ‘natural born Citizen’ in the Constitution encompasses all such citizens from birth. Thus, an individual born to a U.S. citizen parent — whether in California or Canada or the Canal Zone — is a U.S. citizen from birth and is fully eligible to serve as President if the people so choose.”

The two former solicitors general further opined that “The less time spent dealing with specious objections to candidate eligibility, the better.”

In response to an email sent to Cruz via the contact form on his website questioning his constitutional eligibility given his birth in Canada to a non-U.S.-citizen father, a reader recently received the following:

Dear XXXXXXXX,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts regarding immigration issues. Input from fellow Texans significantly informs my decision-making and empowers me to better represent the state.

America has a proud history of welcoming immigrants from around the world, and as the son of a Cuban immigrant, I believe the United States should be a nation that celebrates legal immigrants who come here to pursue the American Dream. But our current system is broken, and the flawed legislation that the Senate passed in 2013 would have only done further harm by failing to secure our border and establishing a special path to citizenship that would only encourage more illegal immigration.

President Obama has further compounded our problems through his illegal executive actions granting amnesty, which defies the will of the American people, disadvantages legal immigrants, jeopardizes our nation’s security, and endangers the children who are being brought across our borders by violent criminals, drug cartels, and sex traffickers.

The President’s executive amnesty exacerbates the crisis at our border and earlier this year Senate Democrats filibustered funding for the Department of Homeland Security to protect this amnesty that was declared illegal by a federal court. In order to keep America strong, I will honor my commitment to continue opposing the President’s amnesty and I will continue working to reform our immigration system to secure our borders, provide American business with a streamlined system for hiring immigrant labor, and uphold the rule of law.

Thank you again for sharing your views with me. Please feel free to contact me in the future about any issue important to your family. It is an honor to serve you and the people of Texas.

For Liberty,

Senator Ted Cruz

After sending us the return letter from Cruz’s office, the reader told us:

I suspect that anyone who writes to Cruz about his ineligibility will get a similar response about immigration. His staff must have a catalog of canned responses from which they select the best choice. Obviously they don’t have a standard response for the most important question of all.

I’m not from Texas but the form letters don’t provide an option for email to non constituents. Ironically, I was just a few feet in front of Cruz when he addressed an anti-Obamacare rally on the Capitol front lawn in September 2013.

Obama himself was called “an immigrant” by former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson during the 2008 presidential campaign. Richardson’s statement, captured by a French television station on video, curiously appears at Google’s website as an error. Google is known to be friendly with the Obama regime.

In determining the meaning of “natural born Citizen,” neither Katyal, Clement, nor the mainstream media has cited “The Law of Nations” of Emmerich de Vattel, a Swiss philosopher whose work is known to have strongly influenced the Framers of the Constitution.

In Section 212 of his treatise, Vattel states:

The citizens are the members of the civil society; bound to this society by certain duties, and subject to its authority, they equally participate in its advantages. The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country, of parents who are citizens. As the society cannot exist and perpetuate itself otherwise than by the children of the citizens, those children naturally follow the condition of their fathers, and succeed to all their rights. The society is supposed to desire this, in consequence of what it owes to its own preservation; and it is presumed, as matter of course, that each citizen, on entering into society, reserves to his children the right of becoming members of it. The country of the fathers is therefore that of the children; and these become true citizens merely by their tacit consent. We shall soon see whether, on their coming to the years of discretion, they may renounce their right, and what they owe to the society in which they were born. I say, that, in order to be of the country, it is necessary that a person be born of a father who is a citizen; for, if he is born there of a foreigner, it will be only the place of his birth, and not his country.

Section 220 states:

§ 220. Whether a person may quit his country.

Many distinctions will be necessary, in order to give a complete solution to the celebrated question, whether a man may quit his country or the society of which he is a member.(60) — 1. The children are bound by natural ties to the society in which they were born; they are under an obligation to show themselves grateful for the protection it has afforded to their fathers, and are in a great measure indebted to it for their birth and education. They ought, therefore, to love it, as we have already shown (§ 122), to express a just gratitude to it, and requite its services as far as possible, by serving it in turn. We have observed above (§ 212), that they have a right to enter into the society of which their fathers were members. But every man is born free; and the son of a citizen, when come to the years of discretion, may examine whether it be convenient for him to join the society for which he was destined by his birth. If he does not find it advantageous to remain in it, he is at liberty to quit it, on making it a compensation for what it has done in his favour,1 and preserving, as far as his new engagements will allow him, the sentiments of love and gratitude he owes it. A man’s obligations to his natural country may, however, change, lessen, or entirely vanish, according as he shall have quitted it lawfully, and with good reason, in order to choose another, or has been banished from it deservedly or unjustly, in due form of law or by violence.

In August 2013, The Dallas Morning News published what it said was a copy of Cruz’s birth certificate which showed that he was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada on December 22, 1970, to Rafael Bienvenido Cruz and Eleanor Elizabeth Wilson. The elder Cruz had sought political asylum in the United States as a refugee during the 1959 Cuban Revolution, and Wilson was reportedly born in Delaware and a U.S. citizen.

Rafael Cruz, however, sought and obtained Canadian citizenship while he and his wife were working in the oil industry during the late 1960s and early 1970s, as he revealed in a 2013 interview with NPR. He did not become a U.S. citizen until 2005, when his son was approximately 35 years old.

It is unknown if Eleanor Wilson also obtained Canadian citizenship, although columnist JB Williams has suggested that she did. If both Cruz’s parents were Canadian citizens at the time of their child’s birth in Canada, like Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cruz could not be considered a natural born American citizen.

The Office of Vital Statistics of Alberta declined to release to The Post & Email Ted Cruz’s birth record, citing privacy laws. Similarly, neither the U.S. State Department nor US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will release any documentation it may have on Cruz’s citizenship without his written consent.

The Post & Email has written to Cruz to ask that Cruz consent to release more documentation on his background. In late April, we received confirmation that a certified letter raising the issues sent to Cruz’s campaign office was received.

Last month, The Post & Email received a copy of Cruz’s Selective Service registration which was reportedly effected through his application for a Pell Grant. We have since written to the U.S. Department of Education for any documentation it may have on Cruz’s financial aid application(s).

Cruz reportedly renounced his Canadian citizenship last May. The government of Canada asks on its renunciation application if the person so renouncing has or will shortly have citizenship in another country.

The Dallas Morning News raised the question of Cruz’s dual Canadian-US citizenship as it related to presidential eligibility but mentioned nothing of Obama’s claimed dual citizenship with the United States and Kenya, given that his claimed father, who was born in Kenya as a British citizen, became a citizen of the new country when it declared its independence from Great Britain in December 1963.

Beginning in 2009, Atty. Jack Maskell of the Congressional Research Service argued that both Sen. John McCain, who was born in Panama to two US-citizen parents, and Barack Hussein Obama, who was reportedly born in Hawaii to a US-citizen mother and his British-citizen father, were eligible to serve as president.

Many perceive Obama as un-American and disrespectful to America’s war dead on the solemn holiday of Memorial Day. Obama has claimed Honolulu, HI; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Chicago, IL to be his “home town.” In July, he plans to visit Kenya, which his wife has called his “home country.”

Since 2007, anyone publicly questioning Obama’s citizenship status, allegiance, or intent to “fundamentally transform the United States of America” has received ridicule, threats, spam email, surveillance, website breaches and other forms of harassment.

In 2012, a criminal investigation revealed that Obama’s only two forms of identification officially released from the federal government, a long-form birth certificate image posted on the White House website and a purported registration form from the Selective Service System, are “computer-generated forgeries.”

No law enforcement, prosecutorial, or congressional action has been taken on the revelations.",2017-11-10T11:18:44.524042,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Cruz Replies to Eligibility Question with “Immigration” Answer,"John Gault, T.F.

An international women's treaty banning discrimination has been ratified by 169 countries so far (without emasculating men in any of them!), yet it has languished in the United States Senate ever since President Carter sent it there for ratification in 1980. This month the Senate Foreign Relations Committee got around to holding hearings on it, but the Bush administration, after shyly supporting it at first, now is finding its courage faltering.

The support came from Colin Powell's State Department, but then John Ashcroft's Justice Department found out about the treaty -- and seems to be trying to defend America from the terrifying threat of global women's rights. You'd think he might have other distractions, like fixing the F.B.I., but the Justice Department is conducting its own review of the treaty in what looks suspiciously like an effort to eviscerate it.

I wish Mr. Ashcroft could come here to Pakistan, to talk to women like Zainab Noor. Because, frankly, the treaty has almost nothing to do with American women, who already enjoy the rights the treaty supports -- opportunities to run for political office, to receive an education, to choose one's own spouse, to hold jobs. Instead it has everything to do with the half of the globe where to be female is to be persecuted until, often, death.

555 West 25th Street, Chelsea

Through Oct. 12

In 1964 the newly independent nation of Zambia began a space program with the intention of putting the first African on the Moon. The program was short-lived, but it reflected the excitement and ambitions of a young country.

Starting with that story, the Spanish artist Cristina de Middel created “The Afronauts,” a body of photographs, drawings and related sculptures. Fictional in most respects, “The Afronauts” nonetheless opens with an enlarged reprint of an actual letter from one Zambian minister to another, saying that “America and Russia may lose the race to the Moon, according to Edward Mukaka Nkoloso, Director of the Zambia National Academy of Space Research.” The program needed money, though. The budding astronauts “don’t concentrate on spaceflight,” according to the letter. “There’s too much lovemaking when they should be studying the Moon.” What’s more, the 17-year-old who was “chosen to be the first coloured woman on Mars, has also to feed her 10 cats, who will be her companions on the long spaceflight.”

Ms. Middel’s faux re-creation includes photographs shot in Spain of people wearing spacesuits sewn from African fabric, and helmets that were streetlamp globes. Archival shots of African villages are altered to include midcentury astronauts. Defunct concrete-mixing drums double as space capsules, and an image shot in Monument Valley is a reference to U.F.O.’s and otherworldly landscapes.

“The Afronauts” is a smart and charming show. Rather than ridiculing Zambia’s ambitions, Ms. Middel compares them to the dreams of other nations and peoples. But the subject here is also photography. Like her fellow Spaniard Joan Fontcuberta, Ms. Middel shows how the medium promotes both fact and fiction — and how ultimately this helped fuel the space race.",2018-02-11 00:46:59.687549,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,Cristina de Middel: ‘The Afronauts’,"Martha Schwendener, Art In Review",,"['Photography', 'Zambia', 'Art', 'Middle  Cristina de', 'Middel  Cristina de']","The Spanish artist Cristina de Middel’s “Afronauts,” a body of photographs, drawings and related sculptures, is a smart and charming show.",,,nytimes
7815,7031005.0,commentarymagazine.com,political,https://www.commentarymagazine.com/american-society/its-ok-to-say-no-to-obama/,"On Monday, Trump’s DOJ announced that it would sue to prevent the “vertical merger” between AT&T, a content distributor, and Time Warner, a content provider and the company that owns CNN. It was a strange decision by an administration that has so far been unflappably friendly toward big business. It contradicts a move by the FCC last week, which made it easier for local-market media companies to consolidate by doing away with dated ownership restrictions. What’s more, as the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, this is the first effort by the Justice Department to sue to block a vertical merger since 1977’s United States v. Hammermill Paper Co., which the government lost.

In a recent interview predating the DOJ’s announcement, the Trump administration’s top antitrust regulator, Makan Delrahim, insisted that politics must not interfere with enforcement matters. “That would be antithetical to everything I’ve stood for,” he said, adding that the government could risk upsetting the marketplace by issuing abrupt changes to standing U.S. antitrust legal theory. Usually, the government seeks an out-of-court settlement that would mitigate a vertical deal’s potentially negative consequences for consumers and competitors. Not in this case. For Trump, this deal must not go through.

He said as much himself. “I’m not going to get involved in litigation,” Trump declared before promptly involving himself in litigation. “Personally,” he added in the same breath, “I’ve always felt that was a deal that’s not good for the country.” Delrahim has since changed his tune on the potential threat to the marketplace posed by abrupt and seemingly arbitrary shifts in its antitrust theory. “[T]here is an instinctive reaction to big business these days,” Delrahim said in the interview he now insists was taken out of context. “There are people who think big is just bad.” Yes, those people are called liberals.

In January, a group of 13 Democratic senators signed a letter indicating that they were skeptical of how an AT&T/Time Warner merger would “serve the public interest.” Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Al Franken, Cory Booker, and others demanded that these two companies demonstrate how their joining would benefit consumers and serve the “broader policy goals of the Communications Act.” That’s not how this works; the burden is on the government to demonstrate why this commercial transaction is not in the public interest. These Democrats’ letter concluded with an admission that their opposition to a potential vertical merger between AT&T and Time Warner was entirely political: “We maintain that further consolidation in the telecommunications and media industries should only be permitted if it results in better and more affordable services for consumers across the nation.”

That was, in essence, the Obama administration’s stance on this issue. Gene Kimmelman, an Obama-era antitrust official, told the New York Times that this merger could be a “disaster for consumers” if it prevented the ongoing disruption of the cable marketplace by online video providers. But even the Obama administration allowed vertical mergers between companies that were not direct competitors. The 2011 deal that combined Comcast and NBC involved bigger risks to the marketplace than those posed by the merger between Time Warner and AT&T. Despite Obama’s acquiescence, liberals opposed that deal, and they oppose this one.

In a rare display of affection for Donald Trump, Matt Stoller—a fellow at the liberal Open Markets Institute—heaped praise on the administration’s new antitrust policy. He noted, though, that it is at least conceivable that Trump could be leaning on his DOJ to punish CNN. “If true, Trump would not be not the first president to consider using antitrust to achieve political ends,” Stoller observed. “President Richard Nixon once demanded the Justice Department hold off on an antitrust suit against ITT for partisan reasons.” That’s not a defense. It’s an indictment.

The fact is that the government’s case seems a weak one. It must now demonstrate why a company that accounts for 10 percent of cable and broadcast viewership should not merge with a firm that has just 25 million video subscribers, down a half million this year alone. Those disruptive online video providers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, and so on) boast tens of millions more subscribers and are partnering with AT&T’s competitors to provide subscription incentives and alternative distribution methods. Delrahim himself once said that he did not view this prospective merger as “a major antitrust problem.” The government has major hurdles to overcome in court, which is why it will need all the political cover it can get.

It seems likely that Trump is looking for that very political cover from his erstwhile free-market allies in the GOP by aggravating their persecution complex. Conservatives don’t like how CNN treats them, their views, their causes, and their president. Therefore, maybe they will look the other way while the government uses the levers of the state to punish the network’s owners, distorting the marketplace and freezing capital in the process. They might, but they shouldn’t.

There is nothing conservative in this decision. The economic or legal theories that justify this move are dubious. On its face, the DOJ’s decision is arbitrary and vindictive. Conservatives who endorse it because of its effects on a suspect media outlet are sacrificing character and conscience. This decision compels conservatives to abandon principle and endorse liberal economic objectives only to satisfy a desire to see their perceived adversaries suffer.

Trump is establishing a precedent that will be used against conservatives and their interests in the near future. The president’s prosecution of the culture wars on Twitter has enlivened his base, but this represents a shift from the venal to the vindictive. It has the appearance of an abuse of power, and conservatives are right to look upon it with skepticism. If they shrug this off, it will demonstrate that anti-Trump conservatives were right all along.",2017-11-27T01:14:21.395055,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468038,2018-02-08 19:18:34.468066,It's OK to Say No to Obama,"Jennifer Rubin, Sohrab Ahmari, Noah Rothman, John Podhoretz, John Steele Gordon, Jonathan Marks, Abe Greenwald",,[''],A Journal of Significant Thought and Opinion,"john conyers, duke university, Washington, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Valerie Jarrett, CNN, BDS, president, sexual harassment, Jasbir Puar, Nancy Pelosi, at&T, Al Franken, Donald Trump, Advisor, Barack Obama, White House",,

Dear infected and afflicted,

We are The Dropouts. We are Ephraim Gregory Nicholas Romanov Rasputin Moscovitch, fourth generation descendant of the formerly secret Romanov/Rasputin bloodline and Colonel Ryan J. Arlington, former Engineer for a U.S.A. Army unit based in a secret deep underground military base, the location of which will remain secret, for now.

Ephraim dropped out of high school and Colonel Arlington went AWOL. Dropouts all have their personal reasons for dropping out and the shared realization of corruption. High school dropouts may lack the vocabulary to adequately explain dropping out, but are often the most astute at sensing corruption reasoning dropping out. The indoctrination of the postmodern public education system restricts thinking and inhibits communication. Only after dropping out could Ephraim effectively communicate his reasons for doing so. Dropouts know something is wrong, if only intuitively, and exit. Dropouts frequently lack the education, diluted with martial training and the prescribed vocabulary thereof, to be able to properly explain themselves, but dropouts know.

Scholastic bureaucracy was built for multiplication of human monoculture and employment of teachers rather than enlightenment of students. Because of indoctrination rather than instruction, Ephraim dropped out. All dropouts know something is wrong, intuitively or exactly, and perform the only moral act at their disposal, leave.

After dropping out, one begins answering questions about the immersion in dehumanization, whether through school or the military. Dropouts are people whose morality and curiosity engages, increases so much they have to answer the questions that arise as to corruption, people who realize the overall wrong and cease participation in it as much as humanly possible.

Colonel Ryan J. Arlington dropped out from the upper echelon of the global military industrial complex, much later in life and from a much higher position than Ephraim, but because of corruption the same. The Colonel was a high level operative whose clearance was so high, he didn’t have an official clearance, nor did he have a rank or serial number, nor was his unit named, nor is their base known publicly. The unit operates so secretively there is no official record of it or The Colonel at all. For The Colonel to dropout he had to go AWOL and live on the lamb permanently, while Ephraim had to face the stigma of being constantly labeled uneducated and unofficial. Being a dropout requires one actively surmount such obstacles. Dropouts cannot be lazy, contrary to popular opinion.

Currently we are being hunted down by the very global military industrial complex to which The Colonel gave over thirty years of his life to, because we are dropouts who know. We are being hunted because we know secrets, to be specific, we hold the most diabolical series of secrets to ever concern humanity. Because of the secrets we know about the threats to humanity, our existence is threatened. Because our existence is threatened in multiplicity, we are revealing our secrets now.

Dropouts are far more trustworthy than any insider. Ruffian copouts, credentialed bowouts and intellectual sellouts, all lie the same, all the time. Dropouts are unofficial and unaccredited, but honest, we have to be because we are outside their game. As noted we are being hunted down by killing machines of great capability and have nothing to lose, as most all dropouts. But more importantly, as dropouts, we have nothing to gain. Dropouts are consistently more trustworthy and more honest than copouts, sellouts and bowouts because we have nothing to gain.

People are trained to ignore dropouts. These same people lend complete trust to official copouts, bowouts and sellouts and are repeatedly tricked. People revere collegiate and corporate credentials, and extensive militaristic ties and corporate experience, but these aren’t evidence of honesty, but commitment to lies. If you spend any time out from under the wing of institutions, you know it takes honesty to dropout. No degree reflects honesty, however dropping out indicates plenty of it. To live outside the box you have to be actively observant and to survive for any length of time you have to be honest. Dropouts are the realest people on Earth. Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were all dropouts.

Being a dropout is a serious qualification. We dropped out because of perpetual corruption and war. The global military industrial complex, including your local law enforcement, is the only growing industry on the planet. Becoming a pair of muted boots to step on people at the whim of strangers is the easy way to earn a living with benefits, it’s a copout. Anybody can work for the biggest industry on the planet, as long as you adopt notions of legality and stomp out any sense of morality, and the same goes for being a corporate bowout or sellout.

It takes honesty to dropout. Signing up with uniformed bullies in support of the global military industrial complex is easy, but it’s a lie. Dropping out, living life according the Golden Rule, is always difficult, especially in an economy based on indiscreet war, but it’s honest. The machinery of the war world is set up for copouts, bowouts and sellouts. And dropouts tend to be the ones most well positioned to be grinded up by their corruption. And alternatively are usually the only ones who stand up to it.

War results in more war. The drug war builds prisons instead of schools, motivates contraband gangs and reduces the quality of life, pushing half of society to conclude narcotic escape is a decent choice, even if it risks prison time, or poisoning. In the same way war leads to buildup of terrible war machines, terrorists and terrorism, copout countries. All war destroys the environment. All war enslaves all people. All war is war on humanity and entirety. Similar such exploits inspired Jesus to curse the military industrial complex in his father’s house two-thousand years ago. Dropouts reject corrupt tradition, and toss tables, and that’s what we’re here to do.

They are lying to you. That’s what Jesus said too. Practically everything you know is a lie. And practically every lie is related to the concealment of the bloody web of war, to hide horrors and inspire enlistment. Practically everything you thought was education and valuable tradition, is simply part of a model to compel you to like what you do; stay in your place in the pyramid system holding down the many for the benefit of the few. And even though practically everything you know is a lie and all the lies weaved by the oligarchies for the last couple thousand years have been to keep the many below, enslaved and ignorant, the lies are all mitigated to unimportant tangents, inconsequential relative to the secrets of our current quandary. The military industrial complex has run the world for thousands of years and it’s all lies. But the secrets we’re revealing now are much bigger than humanity’s prolonged subjugation to martial rule and the lies to maintain such.

Ephraim is a dropout from a family of royal exiles, the direct descendant of Olga Romanov and Gregory Rasputin. Because of his birthright, he was given secrets. Because of the Colonel’s military experience he learned secrets as well. When put together, the information formed an understanding of the world more complete than any before, of a situation more complex than any before.

Ephraim’s main secret, which trivialized the millennia long rule of the global military industrial complex, has been kept secret for millennia by very powerful cabals and kingdoms, including the Romanovs. The secret has been implemented by royalty, religious cults, aristocracies, corporations and factions endlessly throughout history to control people and benefit from that control and has in fact been used to instill the order of the military industrial complex too. The secret however is not a political trick, it’s a biological tick.

The secret is a fluke, the human fluke and its parasitic behavior modification of mankind. The human fluke has been our constant companion, always reducing the human narrative. Nearly everyone has been infected at one point or another and somewhere in the neighborhood of eighty-five percent of the world are hosts to a parasite at any given time. The parasitic predicament has influenced individuals and collectives since the beginning. Practically all children are exposed to it and many never rid themselves of the affliction, some live their entire life knowing nothing but a steady stream of unconsciousness, hosts acting out parasitic impulses. Mankind’s subjection to parasitic behavior modification has shaped the world.

There are numerous human flukes resulting in infections of varying severity. Yet all the human flukes live in one of two ways, resulting in one of two extremes of modified behavior. The slightly more common type is the bacterial dependent fluke, the other is the fungal dependent fluke. They cocoon themselves within bacterial or fungal clusters and attach to the human nervous system to obtain nutrients and modify our behavior. The bacterial dependent infestations result in tolerant, passive behavior, like sheep. The fungal infections result in scheming, aggressive behavior, like coyotes.

This parasitic predicament, like everything in nature, becomes balanced, and in this case in an eloquent dis-symbiosis favoring the parasites. The different parasites develop interdependent balance with the bacterial and fungal clusters as well as their hosts, and more complexly, they relate to each other through modifying the behavior of the host. The parasitically guided interaction between people made sheepish or coyote-like is traditionally viewed as some sort of right wing/left wing political constant, but is actually the result of biological duress. The flukes result in evil or total toleration of outright evil. The behavior of about eighty-five percent of us originates not from normal processes, but is a fluke.

The flukes are frequently mistaken for tumors, or cysts, or meningitis by both ignorant and insistent physicians. They normally attach themselves to the spinal cord or major nerves around the neck and through the bacterial or fungal clusters leech sustenance and eventually basically control their human hosts through insistent primordial parasitic impulses they employ through tapping into nerve endings.

The tolerant, passive and bullied, those who seek to be controlled in order to survive are host to bacterial dependent flukes. The authoritarian and selfish, those who place themselves above all else with reckless abandon, those who seek to control in order to survive, are host to fungal dependent flukes. The flukes, despite being among the lowest life forms in the universe, simply seek to survive and control their hosts simply as a means to do so, but in the process degrade the human condition individually and collectively.

Being severely skinny is indicative of fungal dependent flukes. Hosts to bacterial dependent flukes tend to bloat, otherwise there are no immediate discernible physical symptoms. There are many alchemical antidotes however most the diagnosis procedures and treatments are unnecessarily risky. Alchemical cures involve calculations of quantity, potency and frequency of dose pertaining to the particular individual and the particular fluke. Mercury, cyanide and large quantities of gold are active ingredients in these remedies. In appropriate dilution the concoctions kill the parasites and leave the host unharmed. If the dilutions are miscalculated the host can be killed.

There are holistic cures too, secretively exchanged among nomads and monks for millennia. The parasites cannot thrive or long survive in a host with a vegan diet. Massive amounts of almonds and apricots eaten will eventually kill the flukes. In stomach acid the combination produces therapeutic cyanide which kills parasites. Certain extracts of wormwood, tobacco and cloves can kill the flukes too, however we are unsure of the exact quantities, modes of delivery and time periods required for effectiveness. Practicing yoga or tai chi hasten the results of these holistic cures, but even still the apricots and almonds cure requires up to three months of eating as many almonds and apricots as you can along with vegan diet.

There is one practical cure. And it was long ago made contraband and is mostly still. The most practical cure is the consumption of marijuana. It’s safe, works quickly and is inexpensive, relieving the host of the parasite in weeks, while just one dose is capable of loosening the parasitic grip on the nervous system. The primary reason marijuana is globally prohibited is because of this, because it kills flukes. And those in the know who use and foster the parasitic predicament for their own parasitic gains made it so. Adding to the complexity of the dis-symbiotic relationship of the fluke and man are the occult who know and manipulate the infected. They have tried to restrict knowledge of all curatives and access to the most reasonable one; marijuana. The global drug war began with the prohibition of marijuana and hemp. Most realize this was to protect business interests, make the rich richer and in turn keep poor people poor, but most don’t realize there was much, much more.

Parasitic behavioral modification has influenced all of history. People announce deductive reasoning for their actions, why they think the way they do and yet frequently, eighty-five percent of the time, foreign biological impulses are controlling their motivations. Their reasoning, however complicated, is just vocalization of fungal or bacterial impulses controlling them. Scientists are well aware of parasitic behavior modification in the animal world, but most refuse to consider the possibility of human flukes. Others will openly acknowledge various such infections, but won’t address it further. They can’t.

Of all the scientifically acknowledged behavior modifying parasites, toxoplasma gondii is the most researched and understood. Toxoplasma gondii depends on felines to reproduce and uses rats to gain access to cats in this mortal dis-symbiosis. It supposedly doesn’t harm cats, but rats host to toxoplasma gondii lose all sense of self-preservation and mortal danger. The toxoplasma gondii infested rats bowout to cats, no longer afraid of the scent of feline danger. The rat likely has its own personal, logical reasons for making an introduction to the cat, that if it were capable of explaining it would, but the toxoplasma gondii is in control. And the cat kills the rat according to the toxoplasma gondii plan, so it can reproduce in the feline digestive tract.

Grasshoppers infested with spinochordodes tellinii must individually conclude it’s sensible to jump into water, but it’s the worm’s plan, in order to burst forth from out the drowning grasshopper and swim away. And ants taken over by ophiocordyceps unilateralis believe, in whatever capacity ants believe a thing, that they are deciding to ascend to the top of the stalk, but it is only so the parasite can have a nice place to spore out from within the ant.

Human hosts subject to parasitic behavior modification have eloquent rationale for upholding political principles and being fascist enslavers or obedient slaves to fascists, but the real reason people act dominant or submissive is totally biological, not political or logical. Healthy people don’t act like that. Most of us are hosts, in a parasitic predicament more elaborate than that of the rat, the cat and toxoplasma gondii.

Toxoplasma gondii does infect people and has been known to make old ladies snap and lure young children to play catch in traffic. It can however only reproduce in felines and because of this, it’s theorized, it tricks its host that is not a cat, to lose its most primal fears, so the host kills itself, so it can get out of the dead thing and hopefully into a cat. In the case of the rat their primal fear is the scent of feline urine, the cat and sure death. People infected with toxoplasma gondii frequently take part in risky and destructive behavior and maybe rationalize it’s for adrenaline or adventure, but in reality it’s so that they die and the parasite is released, all according to the parasite’s plan. Humans, sheep, bovines or whatever else becomes host to toxoplasma gondii are all affected in one way or another. Fungal dependent parasites, like toxoplasma gondii and the fungal dependent human flukes, increase the production of testosterone as well as removing instinctual fears. Bacterially infected hosts are drawn to that testosterone, in submission.

The human flukes are dependent on primates to reproduce, only unlike toxoplasma gondii they remain within their hosts indefinitely, they don’t need to leave and when one dies, another takes its place. The parasitic predicament, this dis-symbiosis of man, comes together in a way more intricate than perhaps any other similar system on the planet, of parasite with host, parasite with complimenting fungi or bacteria, the afflicted hosts acting out parasitic impulses among collectives with one aggressive group and another passive group in modified interaction, and finally the occult groups, parasitic themselves through fostering the parasites among the majority and restricting the cure in order to control the infected collective.

As dropouts in a war world of infected and afflicted we have limited medical education and do not know every specific of the parasite’s lifecycle. However the important things to know are that through it people are subjugated to do and accept corrupt inhuman evils and most importantly; the cure is marijuana.

Exposure to fecal matter is the most common mode of transmission, mostly through the consumption of undercooked flesh it is theorized, though contact with a human host is possible mode of transmission. The specifics of the mode of transmission and how they reproduce is unknown and inconsequential. Avoiding or at least charring meat is recommended. But the most important things to remember are the parasites make people unreasonably aggressive or inhumanly passive, the occult foster the parasitic predicament and the most practical cure is marijuana. Marijuana literally frees your mind.

The parasites are everywhere and yet there is a threat to mankind greater than the parasitic predicament. The most affronting threat pertains to global environmental destruction. The destruction is everywhere, worst though, in our fragile atmosphere. The sun used to be a mellow golden color and now it appears whiter due to radioactive particulate causing atmospheric breakdown. Atmospheric turbulence, global warming and drought are all caused by the inability of the atmosphere to release heat due to congestion of radioactive particulate.

The global military industrial complex began a geoengineering or restoration experiment in 1999. The degradation of the atmosphere is in part the result of the expulsion of chemicals and gasses, but primarily is due to saturation of radioactive particulate. The wave emitting particulate is at the root of atmospheric destruction, now notable in the appearance of the sun.

The geoengineering project injects negatively charged particulate into the atmosphere to attract the positively charged radioactive particulate which then potentially begins to fall out of the atmosphere. The injection of particulate to reduce the problem of the atmospheric radioactivity limits access to vitamin D, as well as doses everything with radioactive fallout. Lacking vitamin D degrades our immune systems making us more susceptible to sickness, including parasitic behavior modification.

The operation to fortify the atmosphere with negatively charged particulate is the final act to salvage the unsustainable nuclear experiment and the wave emitting particulate destroying our atmosphere. Instead of announcement on the atmospheric degradation and change, the military industrial complex instituted the secret program to counteract the degradation.

The secret of the parasitic predicament and the occult who foster is almost laughable compared to the secrets the Colonel was burdened with, beginning with the radioactive atmospheric degradation. The degradation of the atmosphere is just one threat brought on by nuclear experimentation. Thermonuclear war of course is another. But the real story of nuclear experimentation, the real, most immediate resulting threat, has never been revealed publicly, until now.

In the beginning, the U.S.A. gathered together some of the wildest scientific minds in history and eventually set off the first nuclear detonation in New Mexico, July 1, 1945. Then two more bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. World war was won and world history was forever altered. The experiment was so dangerous, the forces so outrageous that the scientists debated on whether or not the first detonation would set off a chain reaction igniting the atmosphere, killing all life on Earth. Of course they went ahead anyway.

The first detonation did not start a chain reaction setting the atmosphere afire. It did however start a chain reaction that began the atmospheric degradation we see today. It also set off another more dangerous chain reaction involving subjects very much beyond the pale of our traditional comprehension.

The first nuclear detonation occurred in the New Mexico desert valley accurately named the Jornada del Muerte, meaning the route of the dead man. The code name for the test was Trinity and the bomb itself was known as The Gadget. In July, 1945 we all began the journey of death -in secret. And on August 6 and 9, the most horrific nuclear experiments imaginable took place, the bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Then the whole world knew of the Journada Del Muerte.

A few people survived both bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, having gone from one city to escape the other. Around 70,000 human spirits were instantly vanquished in Hiroshima and nearly that many in Nagasaki, though it’s impossible to know an exact figure, for most people were disappeared, atomized. Many more hundreds of thousands died from burns, injuries and cancers after the bombings. July 16, 1945 is a date that will live in infamy. It is the day everything changed, when Pandora’s Box was pried open and humanity set forth on the journey of the dead man and the vaporizing of cities in August showed using Pandora in the worst way imaginable.

Incidentally, there was a box set next to the Trinity detonation which supposedly contained a living being of some sort for a top secret experiment. Some say there was a demon inside it. Others say the explosion itself released the demon. The official story states the box contained sensitive testing equipment. There is no denying the demon that is nuclear, but the literal demonic release is an unsubstantiated rumor. It was called the demon core and was purposefully mixed up with an accident-prone piece of plutonium also called the demon core. The same name supposedly covered up the actual demonic experiment. What is certain is that nuclear experimentation began in a stew of secrets, lies, omissions, whispers, rumors and silenced science, the devil’s favorite tools.

July, 16, 1945 initiated the nuclear experimentation era, the total war on terra. Since then thousands of nuclear detonations have occurred; in the atmosphere, on the ground, underground and in the ocean. Each one of the detonations started chain reactions of entropy we are only beginning to understand. Now hundreds of nuclear experiment reactors around the world boil water for electricity, with adjacent fuel pools, each requiring constant attention, each so poisonous, just one is capable of altering or destroying entirety. The waste is so dangerous it can only be made into weaponry, or buried, or blasted off to Jupiter, or put somewhere requiring attention for the next ten thousand generations. Tons of depleted uranium has been exploded and an unknown tonnage of radioactive waste is now enveloping the planet from releases and routine accidents. Nuclear experimentation is a war on terra, a war on life itself.

J. Robert Oppenheimer was the most prominent scientist to work on the Manhattan Project to create the Gadget. Oppenheimer opened Pandora’s Box. Coincidentally his last name, from a region in Germany, eerily means open home. He opened the box and opened the door to our home. And not so incidentally, he was a friend of the Rosenburgs, who gave nuclear technology to the Soviets.

He famously quoted a Hindu parable after witnessing the fruition of his handiwork, “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty. And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‘Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that.”

There is no going back to pre-Pandora Earth. Japan surrendered and the U.S.A. was proudly the world’s first super power. The detonations on Hiroshima and Nagasaki got the attention of the world. Ironically though, the top secret detonation in New Mexico got the attention of others, elsewhere.

Nuclear detonations create a unique electromagnetic pulse of metaphysical destruction. There is the notable explosion, the electromagnetic pulse, the poisonous radioactive fallout and the detrimental atmospheric chain reactions due to introduction of the wave emitting particles, the lingering entropy and also, according to Colonel Ryan J. Arlington, there are extra-dimensional reactions. The detonations crack the space-time continuum.

The detonation from the explosion in New Mexico sent a destructive and unique ping rippling across space, notifying the universe that a nuclear detonation occurred. Each subsequent detonation was another pulse sent across the vibrational sea of the universe which said, ‘We’re over here and we’re stupid enough to light off nukes.’

The pings got the attention of all interstellar life in the universe. Extraterrestrial beings soon arrived to Earth to investigate the nuclear detonations in our remote corner of the universe. Some were aware we were here prior and some only learned who it was and where we were through the nuclear pings.

The Federation of bipedals were aware of Earthlings before the pings. And soon enough Federation representation contacted earthen leadership, but unbeknownst to the Federation, a rogue extraterrestrial race outside the Federation had clandestinely arrived to Earth before them. July 16, 1945 was the beginning of modern times and on July 17 postmodern decay began.

The Federation’s immediate concern was to cease nuclear experimentation to protect the spirits of mouse and man alike from the detonations. They informed the leadership that beings killed in such detonations are not just killed, their spirit is obliterated, permanently dematerialized. The detonations physically destroy beings and places, crack the space-time continuum and incinerate spirits, the most ungodly act a being can do. The Federation revealed the true scope of the detonations and the existence of spirit within all living beings. They further revealed the existence of god which is said to have greatly upset the politicians.

The Federation provided a myriad of reasons to discontinue nuclear experimentation, chief among being the destruction of the very ethereal essence. They informed the earthen leadership that the myth of Pandora’s Box is about nuclear experimentation. And that nuclear experimentation would result in Federation ostracism, generational biological degradation and inevitable extinction.

The Federation knew about our legend of Pandora’s Box, they knew our languages and cultures and mythology. They knew the whole human story, every legend and every myth. They didn’t know about the last seven hundred years, but they knew our history.

The Federation arrived in July, 1952, by then 37 detonations had taken place. They went straight to Washington D.C. and their visits that summer made national headlines. Videos, photographs and reports of their visits to Washington D.C. in 1952, number in the thousands. President Harry Truman himself addressed and denied the public questioning concerning extraterrestrials landing on the White house lawn.

The Federation revealed information on the catastrophic results of opening Pandora’s Box and the history of humankind, which was much like our history on Earth, dotted by wars and regrettable acts. The heavily redacted history revealed that there was once a great war between bipedals in the Andromeda System over a magical mineral. The rejuvenating mineral compound was thought to be in limited supply. And beings risked their existence for it. After realization there was plenty of the mineral, the war ended. It was found humans instigated the conflict and hid where the mineral could be found in abundance, solely because we didn’t want a specific race to have the mineral. The newly formed Federation debated on the extermination of mankind for starting the war, but instead they genetically altered our mental capacity and banished humans to remote prison planets. The reason people only use seven percent of our brain capacity is because of the genetically implemented mental deformity. Supposedly when humans first arrived to prison Earth people quarried stones and erected structures with simplistic devices powered by electromagnetics and the mind.

Telekinesis and free energy technology were considered simple among bipedals without the genetic mental hindrance. Free energy technology supposedly utilizes the electromagnetic Higgs Boson counter-wave to manipulate and transform gravity and electromagnetism through consciousness. Subatomic particles behave as waves, only a very few, actually have weight, they are known as Higgs Boson particles. The counter-wave can make the dense malleable and the heavy become light. Generations after the implant we became incapable of understanding how to use the force.

The Federation informed the leadership that if we continued nuclear experimentation we would never be allowed free energy technology. Originally it was assumed the Federation meant it would restrict our access to free energy technology as a consequence, but the disruption of the space time continuum and electro-magnetosphere caused by nuclear experimentation is what prevents access to the unlimited energy through the otherwise smooth space-time continuum. Nuclear experimentation disrupts the space-time continuum in a way that makes the counter-wave inaccessible. Free energy is near impossible to access due to the present electromagnetic conditions.

There are other planets of mentally deformed humans, but only we have conducted nuclear experimentation. In fact, only a few other species in the whole universe have ever transformed their planet into a nuclear experiment and their fate is ours, deformity and extinction. No one in the universe is considered as stupid and violent as Earthlings. And at the same time, human humor is universally renowned. Even today, despite our deformity, our jokes are still considered some of the finest entertainment known. Beings travel light years just to watch us.

Harry Truman, in true manly fashion, did not trust the Federation. After all, the aliens were critical of nuclear experimentation and the obliteration of Japanese cities, the very act that made the U.S.A. the world’s super power. The Federation insisted they cease nuclear experimentation and make peace on Earth. In exchange they would offer membership into the Federation. Harry Truman took this to be a sly plot and after winning World War II no one in the universe was going to tell the United States to disarm. Harry Truman didn’t believe them, not after what happened in Roswell and elsewhere.

The Federation insisted if there was peace on Earth, if nuclear experimentation was ceased, they would provide free energy technology, interplanetary travel technology and planetary defense from rogue races. The Federation did not know that one of those rogue races was already here. The race we know as the Greys were the first to detect the atomic ping from Earth and the first to arrive here. The Earthen leadership was suspicious of the Federation because of their experiences with the Greys.

The Greys possess all the technology the Federation does, but operate outside Federation law. When it comes to detection of nuclear experimentation the Greys possess technology superior to that of Federation. In fact, there is no race which understands nuclear experimentation better than the Greys and consequently no race more negatively altered by it. The Greys learned about nuclear experimentation in the universe and in the process destroyed their home planet and their genetic viability. They were a dying race.

The Greys completed their journey to Earth in 1947. A scout ship crashed in Roswell, New Mexico that summer, a hop skip and jump away from the Trinity test site. The crash landing ended in the first confrontation. The events at Roswell and other provocative actions made Harry Truman distrust the Federation mistaking them for Greys.

The Greys were aware of our history, but only learned of our location when we pinged the cosmos. The Greys were banished from the Federation for opening Pandora’s Box thousands of years ago. Ultimately they had to evacuate their home planet because of failed nuclear experimentation. The Greys are highly intelligent, but their ardent theology states they are God’s chosen bipedal and because of this they believed they could not be harmed by nuclear experimentation.

The Greys were a dying race and been traversing the universe seeking an unclaimed and habitable planet with DNA and RNA of a suitable race to use to reconstitute their genetic viability. The Gadget went off just in time for them to find us, a whole planet of near unaltered genetics.

After the Greys became aware of the Federation they made their own introduction and deals in order to subvert the Federation. In exchange for technology, not including free energy or interplanetary travel technology, the Greys were harvested DNA and RNA. Many of the missing persons of the world were kidnapped by Greys.

Eventually the Federation became aware of the Greys and informed the Earth governments of the trickery. The Greys subverted the efforts of the Federation to stop nuclear experimentation, because they want to destroy us. They wanted our genes, and now they want Earth. And if humans are no longer genetically viable, under Federation law, the Greys can have Earth. And the quickest way to eliminate our genetic viability is through nuclear experimentation.

Earth powers continued nuclear experimentation, believing we were tapping into the power of the sun. The Greys just wait for nuclear experimentation to eliminate our biological viability, at which time, the Federation would consider the prison planet a failure, whereupon they would no longer be responsible and the Greys could takeover.

The Greys have infiltrated society and transformed nuclear experimentation into what it is today, a way to kill us. The madness of nuclear experimentation has exposed us to a mad, mad universe. The policy shared by the nuclear powers toward deterrence of war is just one aspect of the madness. This policy is known as MAD, mutually assured destruction. It’s the idea that war is deterred through the threat of total destruction. The Greys agenda is to kill Earthlings and begin infiltrated the upper echelons of every relevant institution by about 1952. Since then they’ve been pushing nuclear experimentation, so we kill ourselves and the Federation leaves Earth to them.

The Greys have hybrids, grey skinned near humans who might only be a few years old, but appear as if octogenarians. They are extremely intelligent, but lack emotion and any sense of humor. They typically are named Abbot, Moe, Beaver, Curly or another name they picked up from 1950’s Americana.

The Federation is monitoring the situation. They visit nuclear experimentation facilities, routinely shutting down missile systems and taking out launched, unarmed ICBMs with their ships like collies tracking down Frisbees, but otherwise they are waiting. Colonel Ryan J. Arlington watched a Federation ship he would later learn, zap a missile facility and disable the guidance systems of multiple missiles, three nights in a row.

The Federation can legally do no more than monitor and test. They cannot force their will on prisoners and they have to protect the prisoners -until they are no longer genetically viable. They are also obligated to prevent nuclear experimentation throughout the universe so as to preserve spirit and assure the space-time continuum doesn’t crack apart resulting in an excruciating painful implosion of the universe or Big Ping, resulting in another Big Bang.

The Federation is capable of disabling missiles from and destroying them after they are launched, but even the Federation can’t cease the ongoing reactions at nuclear power generation experiments. The Federation legal conundrum has resulted in a waiting game. The Federation considered freeing us from our genetically implemented binds, but we were distrustful and conniving and we couldn’t stop nuclear experimentation, unconsciously believing that perhaps, we too, were so liked by god, that we could defy the consequences of nuclear experimentation.

Earth could have been the first human planet allowed into the Federation, we could have been a human voice, but we proved unready. The Greys reached our solar system a dying race. They disappeared thousands of people and utilized our genetics to revitalize their altered chromosomes. And now they want Earth. The Federation is stuck in a legal conundrum unable to assist us, unable to force us to cease nuclear experimentation and required to prevent detonations.

We’ve been invaded. Practically every major institution has been compromised to some extent, the nuclear experimentation industry has been almost totally compromised by the hybrids, for many institutions can control us, but nuclear experimentation can kill us. The nuclear experimentation industry is saturated with Grey hybrids so they can set up our MAD. The best way for the Greys to cease humanity’s biological success is to release radioactive particulate. All they have to do is promote nuclear experimentation and make sure people we it to continue, for eventually it will fail and they will win Earth.

The nuclear experiment makes nothing as it was. Rising cancer rates were the first sign of nuclear experimentation gone awry. Next will be declining birth rates. Tobacco was at one time safe when used in moderation. It was sacred to the American Indians and beneficial when smoked with sage as they did. Now tobacco grown outside is dusted with so many radioactive particles, it’s deadly to smoke, part of an out of control experiment, a Pandora.

Nuclear experimentation has degraded all life since 1945, producing such persistent toxins as to be cancerous forever and make future generations less intelligent, less attractive and less biologically successful. Its waste is cancerous, negatively alters genetics and some of it, like Krypton 85 result in dramatic drought. Radioactive particles emit heat for thousands of years and are now dispersed globally in all strata reducing the atmosphere’s ability to release heat, increasing holes in the ozone and the new norm of powerful storms.

The secrets concerning the increase in cancer, decline in birthrates, global warming, drought, the parasitic predicament and the occult who cultivate it, our shackled mental capacity, the fact underground bases exist all over the world partly as contingency plans in case of nuclear devastation are all insignificant next to the takeover. It is humans versus Greys. And the only way to win is to cease nuclear experimentation. And the only way to do that is to become conscious of the problem. The only way to become conscious at all is by eliminating the parasites by smoking copious amounts of marijuana, preferably marijuana grown indoors to minimalize ingestion of radioactive particulate.

Only when we cease nuclear experimentation will the Federation consider siding with humanity. And only when we cease nuclear experimentation will the Greys leave. Until nuclear experimentation ceases, until marijuana is freely distributed, we will take action to shut down all nuclear experimentation. If nuclear experimentation is not ceased there will be another Hiroshima and there will be another Fukushima.

The likelihood of multiple nuclear experiment failures is low, currently. However Colonel Ryan J. Arlington is privy to information on a huge massive object or HMO. The HMO is expected to careen through the solar system and when it does the object may cause the oceans to rise variously by twenty feet or more, which would be minor all things considered, except for the nuclear power plants on the coasts. The HMO could also cause a solar flare on a scale that might burn half the planet and set off a series strong earthquakes. The HMO is bound to cause calamity and yet it only takes a minute act of god to result in nuclear catastrophe. If the sea level rises just five feet, savage nuclear industrial death is possible. Even if the HMO only causes sporadic flooding and earthquakes failure of nuclear experimentation is practically guaranteed. Stop nuclear experimentation or we will stop it. Stop all nuclear experimentation or it will stop us all.

Ours,

Colonel Ryan J. Arlington and Prince Ephraim Gregory Nicholas Romanov Rasputin Moscovitch

Ethan Indigo Smith’s controversial book, The Terraist Letters, humorously contrasts the very serious issues of global nuclear experimentation and global marijuana prohibition. It is a funny and provocative political satire that attempts to brings some sanity to the most serious subject matter of nuclear experimentation, in a way that only Ethan can.

“Ethan’s work will titillate, irritate, but most importantly, stimulate some serious thought concerning current conventions. Give it a read. Your brain might thank you.” ~ New York Times Best Selling author, Jim Marrs

The Complete Patriot’s Guide

Ethan Indigo Smith’s book, The Complete Patriot’s Guide to Oligarchical Collectivism: Its Theory and Practice, is an insightful exploration of history, philosophy and contemporary politics of today’s heavily institutionalized society.

An inspiration for positive, peaceful individual action, The Complete Patriot’s Guide is pro-individual in its perspective and, although political, discusses our society and its institutions from neither left-wing nor right-wing perspectives, exploring history, philosophy and contemporary politics relative to the fictional work of George Orwell. Layered with insight, it is in part a literary exploration of the themes of Orwell’s 1984, and provides solutions for individual and collective empowerment.

41,8689100.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/art-the-lighthearted-puppet-master.html,"THE sculptor Pat Keck is happy to admit that, like Peter Pan, she has never really grown up. At 47 she still lives with her parents in the house where she was raised in a rural suburb of Boston. Here, in a studio nestled in the woods, she builds sculptures inspired by marionettes, automata and ventriloquists' dummies; like a modern-day Gepetto she explores a shadowy realm where inert matter is kindled with the spark of life.

For Ms. Keck's carved wooden figures, however, the capacity to move and to react to the surrounding world is real rather than imagined. She animates her characters through mechanical devices and electronic circuits -- with help from her father, a retired professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her brother, a physicist -- giving literal substance to the age-old myth of the artwork come to life. In their interactions with their human counterparts her sculptures may hector, cajole or spook, but they are never content to just sit around looking pretty.

Yet Ms. Keck's ensembles both delight and entertain, a rare combination in a world that tends to equate accessibility with triviality. Nick Capasso, who organized Ms. Keck's first solo retrospective, on view at the DeCordova Museum here through Jan. 18, said, ''For all their obvious appeal there's a much more disturbing and profound message about life and death, power and control, the animate and inanimate.''

That seems, at first, like rather heavy philosophical baggage for these funny and playfully creepy figures to bear. But spend a little time with Ms. Keck's creations and you're likely agree that there's something insidious going on. After a few minutes you begin to suspect that it's actually your strings that are being pulled.

With their levers, pedals or coin slots, many of these sculptures invite you to come out and play. It's an irresistible, though hardly friendly, gesture. Fifty cents dropped into ''Messengers'' will bring a quartet of seated figures to life, tapping out Morse code messages that seem calculated to perplex and provoke: ''If work were good for you,'' says one, ''the rich would leave none for the poor.'' Step on the pedal of ''Man With an Inner Demon'' and he will bare his tormented soul; the same action applied to ''Memorial to Klaus Nomi'' will, literally, raise the dead. All the while ''Watchman'' follows you with his eyes, drumming his fingers on the arm of his chair in pent up exasperation.",2018-02-11 00:38:09.366971,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,The Lighthearted Puppet Master,Miles Unger,,"['KECK  PAT', 'BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION', 'ART']","Miles Unger profile of and interview with sculptor Pat Keck, who uses mechanical devices and electrical circuits to animate her carved wooden figures; photos (S)",,,nytimes

Today marks the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. While the conventional narrative claims that the gruesome event led to the capitulation of Japan and the end of WWII, new evidence suggests that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not decisive. What implications does this have for the strategy of nuclear deterrence and the value of nuclear weapons in modern geopolitics? Oksana is joined by Ward Wilson, senior fellow at the British American Security Information Council, to look at these issues.

HUD Secretary Ben Carson’s assertion that poverty is a “state of mind” got me thinking. About poverty. And about how Ben Carson is full of shit. From The New York Times: “I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind…You take somebody that has the right mind-set, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there.” This is worse than Ragged Dick nonsense. This isn’t policy. It’s frightening to hear that the man in charge of the 1.3 million units of occupied public housing managed by some 3,400 public housing authorities thinks that a little positive thinking can result in national prosperity. [...] I wonder if residents of New Jersey, which shamefully boasts the sixth highest housing wage in the country and whose residents must earn at least $$26 per hour at 40 hours per week in order to afford the average two-bedroom, market-rate rental without spending more than 30 percent of their income, would benefit from magical, pixie dust thinking? I wonder if Carson has any comprehension of his awesome responsibility as HUD secretary. I know he doesn’t, but clearly he’s undergone poverty conversion therapy, and it seems to be working just fine… for him.

At Dick & Sharon’s L.A. Progressive, Christina Leimer writes—For the Working Poor, the American Dream Is Dead. Unless Minimum Wage Legislation Revives It:

It’s not only the unemployed who need help to buy food. Many people you interact with every day, who are working, need this government assistance. Cashiers, cooks, customer service representatives, groundskeepers, childcare workers, home healthcare assistants, even some degreed professionals such as mental health practitioners may not earn enough money to take care of basic needs. In addition, many of these jobs don’t offer health insurance, retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, paid sick leave or vacation days, or even unpaid family leave. Sometimes, things just aren’t right. And this is one of them. In the U.S., where work is so highly valued and expected, and where the belief is that if you work hard, you’ll get ahead, anyone who works full-time should at least be paid enough to support themselves and their family. Yet, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of people working and receiving government food assistance rose from 19% to 32%. At the same time, the number of low-wage occupations grew. Further, rather than full-time permanent positions, many jobs are now part-time, or temporary, often with varying hours and unpredictable schedules that make it difficult to piece together second and third jobs many need to get by. Most workers in these positions would prefer a full-time job, but they’ve been forced by changing hiring practices into part-time work.

At Democratic Diva of Arizona, Donna writes—“Moderate” Martha McSally votes to yank health care from millions:

x Martha McSally stood up in GOP conference meeting and said let's get this ""fucking thing"" done.



Yes, direct quote Ã¢ÂÂ per members and aides. — Erica Werner (@ericawerner) May 4, 2017 About ending protections from lifelong coverage caps on children born with illnesses, making being a rape or domestic violence victim a preexisting condition, etc. You know, cool stuff like that. I’ve certainly mentioned a time or two the maddening kneejerk tendency of the civic and media establishment in Arizona to ascribe pleasant things like “moderation” and “reasonableness” to Republicans who don’t seem like they’re seconds away from biting the head off a bat on live TV. Arguably no one has benefited more from that tendency in recent years than Martha McSally, who represents the Tucson area CD2 in Congress. [...] That quote from McSally may seem like an uncharacteristically bold statement but it feels like staged political theater to me. The aim of which is people focus on how boldly she said “let’s get this fucking thing done!” and not what she actually fucking did, which was vote to kill people, literally.

At Intelligent Discontent of Montana, Don Pogreba writes—The Greg Gianforte Assault on a Reporter Shouldn’t Surprise Anyone:

Look, this is shocking news. Millionaires usually pay their bodyguards to rough up the press instead of doing it themselves, and it’s rare that a candidate for public office makes international news for assaulting a reporter the night before an election. [...] But it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Gianforte behaved this way. Anyone who has followed Montana politics for the past few years is familiar with his anger when asked questions by the press. Back in October, we had a guest post from Shahid Haque-Hausrath discussing how Gianforte lost his temper when he was interviewed by the Missoulian Editorial Board. He wrote: When pressed again for his list, and asked whether or not Iran was on that list, Gianforte grew irritated and said “I’m not playing this game with you.” Apparently he even was even “pounding the table.” [...] Gianforte is a menace. He supports the worst forms of discrimination, sanctions white nationalists, runs horrifically negative campaigns, and like all bullies, cannot stand to be questioned. You can hear his anger rise every time a reporter asks a hard question or follows up when he refuses to answer. The real surprise might not even be that he assaulted a reporter tonight, but that this is the first time it’s happened.

Cory Allen Heidelberger at the Dakota Free Press writes—Draft Bill Dodges Legislative Responsibility, Doesn’t Resolve Conflicts over Access to Nonmeandered Waters:

At Juanita Jean’s of Texas, Juanita Jean Herownself writes—Let’s Hope That The Punishment For Shoving a NATO Leader Out Of The Way To Be In The Front Of The Picture Is That You Can’t Come Home:

Yes, he did. You know he did. He’s just such a jerk. A real leader parts the opening with his presence. A jerk shoves people.

At Better Georgia, Shelby Steuart writes—The dumbest political ads you’ll ever see:

As Ossoff continues to lead in the polls, conservatives continue to make absurd, fact-free ads attacking him. The two most recent attack ads against Ossoff have become increasingly ridiculous, one of which is leading to a cease-and-desist request from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency for superimposing an Ossoff ad on a San Francisco cable car without permission. NPR called the ad “a sarcastic ad from the Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) featuring actors in San Francisco mockingly thanking Ossoff, ‘their congressman.’” Another CLF ad tried to associate Ossoff with terrorism by calling Al Jazeera a “mouthpiece for terrorism” and saying Al Jazeera “has been paying Ossoff thousands of dollars.” Politifact summarized this ad, saying, “The ad cherry-picked images and a quote that cast Al Jazeera in the most dubious light possible. That characterization was the basis for the rest of the ad.” We shouldn’t be surprised. The Washington Post called the Congressional Leadership Fund’s first ad in the race — the one attacking Jon Ossoff for dressing up like Star Wars characters in college — “one of the dumbest political ads you will ever see.” Fast Company called the same ad the “least creative thing of the day.”

At SaintPetersBlog of Florida, Joe Henderson writes—Joe Henderson: If some Democrats don’t care about ‘issues’ maybe that’s leaders’ fault:

Um, Sally Boynton Brown? If you’re trying to explain why Democratic voters didn’t turn out in sufficient numbers last November to deliver Florida to Hillary Clinton, I suggest a different approach than saying basically “they don’t get it.” That’s not a direct quote from the newly hired executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, but it is the essence of her intemperate remarks at a progressive caucus gathering in Broward County. The Miami New Times, on the scene at the event, quoted Brown saying, “This is not going to be popular, but this is my belief of the time and place we’re in now: I believe that we’re in a place where it’s very hard to get voters excited about ‘issues,’ the type of voters that are not voting.” She was right about one thing: that isn’t popular. In fact, that’s just plain dumb. First, let’s just say what everyone knows: She is effectively blaming lower-income people and minorities for her party’s problems, as if it’s their civic duty to vote for Democrats. These are people profoundly affected by the issues of the day, and you can be damn sure they care about those things. If they aren’t voting, it’s because there is a disconnect between them and party leaders.

At Blue in the Bluegrass of Kentucky, Yellow Dog writes—Take Jeff Davis Statue Out of the KY Capitol Rotunda Now:

Motherfucker might have been born in Kentucky, but he made his home in Mississippi. Contrary to the hallucinations of the Commonwealth's many Defenders of Treason in Defense of Slavery, Kentucky never seceeded from the Union, never committed Treason in Defense of Slavery, never joined the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis has no business looming over people in the Capitol Rotunda as if he were a hero. He's a traitor, and a motherfucking piece of shit. Get his statue the fuck out of there and replace it with one of a genuine Kentucky hero: Muhammad Ali. Erik Loomis on the removal of a statue of Jefferson Davis in New Orleans last week: This is genuinely a wonderful thing. Again, these aren’t “monuments to history.” They are expressions of Jim Crow power, placed on the population of New Orleans at a moment where black voting and social rights had been repressed by force. They served, in the minds of the people who erected them, as social lessons to the black population, reminding them who was still in charge. There is no good reason to keep these statues up. [...] Lexington Kentucky was the biggest slave market north of New Orleans. Long past time the snooty denizens of that city (in which I was raised, so I know of what I write) get their snowy white asses down off their thoroughbred high horses and demand the removal of Jeff Davis.

At Blue Virginia, lowkell writes—Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Slams Trump Muslim Ban: “drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination”:

The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (located in Richmond, Virginia) ruling, released a bit earlier this afternoon, nails it on Trump’s disgraceful, unAmerican, unconstitutional Muslim ban (bolding added for emphasis): “The question for this Court, distilled to its essential form, is whether the Constitution, as the Supreme Court declared in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2, 120 (1866), remains ‘a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace.’ And if so, whether it protects Plaintiffs’ right to challenge an Executive Order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination. Surely the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment yet stands as an untiring sentinel for the protection of one of our most cherished founding principles—that government shall not establish any religious orthodoxy, or favor or disfavor one religion over another. Congress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation. Therefore, for the reasons that follow, we affirm in substantial part the district court’s issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction as to Section 2(c) of the challenged Executive Order.”

At Blog for Iowa, Trish Nelson writes—Dakota Access Motion To Dismiss Denied:

To those who say, “The fight against the Dakota Access pipeline is over, so just move on,” we pipeline fighters and water protectors say, “Not so fast!” Tuesday, the Iowa Supreme Court sided with nine Iowa landowners and the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, rejecting Dakota Access’ request to have the landowners’ lawsuit dismissed! The Court’s order reads: “Dakota Access contends this appeal should be dismissed because the appellant, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, has failed to establish proper standing in this matter and the remaining appellants’ claims are moot. Upon consideration, the motion to dismiss is denied. Dakota Access may raise the issues regarding standing and mootness in its appellate brief.” [...] This is a really big deal. It means the case against the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) and Dakota Access will move forward, with a schedule for court filings being established and a trial likely later this year or early in 2018. The Court’s order revealed another important and disturbing development. Richard W. Lozier, Jr. requested permission to withdraw as counsel for the MAIN Coalition — a front group for Dakota Access. The Court rightfully granted that request. What’s incredible is that Governor Branstad recently appointed Lozier to the IUB, filling the seat vacated by Libby Jacobs, despite this clear conflict of interest!

The Obama administration needs to go the distance and make the case for a constitutional amendment for same sex marriage. They should call on Democrats running in 2014 to adopt such a platform in the upcoming mid-term election.

“Engaging in that process and making that determination is something that’s appropriate for an attorney general to do,” Mr. Holder said.

It is highly unusual for the United States attorney general to advise his state counterparts on how and when to refuse to defend state laws. But Mr. Holder said when laws touch on core constitutional issues like equal protection, an attorney general should apply the highest level of scrutiny before reaching a decision on whether to defend it. He said the decision should never be political or based on policy objections.

The Obama administration continues to go around the legislature or voters. The latest example is AG Holder's statement about same sex marriage bans, as reported by The New York Times

We should not get same sex marriage by refusing to enforce current laws. It will divide the country. It will also deny ""same sex marriage"" the legitimacy that comes from the ballot box.

What if the Bush administration had told state AG's not to enforce federal abortion laws? My guess is that Mr Holder and most Democrats would be up in arms. They would say that laws have to be enforced until they are changed, or reversed in the case of Roe v Wade.

Let's do ""same sex marriage"" the right way by following the US Constitution and the amendment process.

Don't get me wrong. I do not support same sex marriage. However, I'd be willing to accept its existence if it happened the constitutional way not because the US Attorney General tells his state counterparts to enforce the laws they like and not the ones that they don't like.

Someone needs to tell the Obama administration that the US is the longest running democracy in the planet. This is a matter of great pride for millions of Americans who know their history and how exceptional the US is in the world's timeline.

The Obama administration should stop behaving like we live in ""a banana republic."" It insults naturalized citizens like me, and my parents, who have personal experience with ""lawlessness"" and ""government by executive decree"" in Cuba.

Politics

Nuclear Issue

Supreme Leader tells Islamic Student Associations at foreign universities: “Conspiracies and machinations of the enemy, including the ’scientific Apartheid’ which they try to subject our nation to, only strengthens the unity of our people.”

Head of Iran’s Nuclear Energy Agency: “Conditions not right for implementation of the Additional Protocol.”

More reactors coming online?

Military

Admiral Habib-Allah Sayyari, chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy: “Closure of the Hormuz Strait is not under consideration” during upcoming war games.

Added that Iranian-made submarines are soon to leave docks in southern Iran.

Seyyed-Yahya Rahim Safavi, former IRGC head and current advisor to Supreme Leader: “Risk of an attack against Iran is minimal… Iran’s defense doctrine does not entail nuclear weapons.”

Moore played on teams that won the Stanley Cup in 1953 and every year from 1956 to 1960. In addition to the line with Moore and the two Richards, the Canadiens of the 1950s featured Jean Béliveau at center, Bernie Geoffrion and Bert Olmstead at wing, Jacques Plante in goal and Doug Harvey and Tom Johnson on defense. All were Hall of Famers; Moore was inducted in 1974.

Moore was only 5 feet 10 inches and 165 pounds or so, but as he told the Montreal radio station CJAD-AM in 2013, “size didn’t count as far as I was concerned.”

Maurice Richard marveled at Moore’s toughness.

“I once saw him play as a junior in Quebec against Béliveau,” Richard recalled in “The Flying Frenchmen: Hockey’s Greatest Dynasty” (1971), written with Stan Fischler. “Just about the whole Quebec team went after Dickie, but he wasn’t afraid in the least. He fought everybody on the ice, and after that, the Canadiens knew he would make it big in the N.H.L.”

Richard Winston Moore was born on Jan. 6, 1931, in Montreal, one of nine children. As a youngster, he played hockey on an outdoor rink, but when he was 7 he sustained a severe break of his right leg when he was hit by a car while riding his bicycle. Through his long hockey career, the muscle in that leg never developed properly.

Moore joined the Canadiens’ system in 1947, playing junior hockey in Montreal. He made his N.H.L. debut in the 1951-52 season and finished third in balloting for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year, behind Geoffrion and the Rangers’ Hy Buller. But he saw little action in the next two seasons, partly because of a collarbone injury, one of many injuries he incurred as a rugged forward.

Moore became a regular in 1954. He led the N.H.L. in goals, with 36, in the 1957-58 season, adding 48 assists for his league-leading point total of 84, although he skated for much of the season’s second half with a cast on a broken left wrist after a collision with the Detroit Red Wings’ Marcel Pronovost.

Moore had 41 goals with a league-leading 55 assists the next season, and his 96 points broke the N.H.L. single-season record of 95, set by the Red Wings’ Gordie Howe in 1953. (Both marks have been eclipsed many times since.)

Moore retired for the first time after the 1962-63 season. He returned to the N.H.L. two seasons later with the Toronto Maple Leafs, retired again and then concluded his career in 1967-68 with the newly founded St. Louis Blues as the league expanded to 12 teams, from the Original Six.

He finished with a flourish, scoring seven goals and getting seven assists in 18 playoff games in the Blues’ run to the Stanley Cup finals, where they were swept in four games by the Canadiens.

Moore scored 261 goals and had 347 assists in his 14 N.H.L. seasons and played in six All-Star Games.

He is survived by his wife, Joan; a daughter, Lianne; a son, John; and several grandchildren.

Moore thrived in the business world as the founder of Dickie Moore Rentals, a Montreal-based company that provides heavy equipment for construction work.

The Canadiens retired the No. 12 worn by Moore and Yvan Cournoyer, their Hall of Fame wing of the 1960s and ’70s, in a ceremony at Bell Centre in November 2005.

Although Moore teamed with a host of marquee figures of the 1950s in wearing the Canadiens’ red and blue, he was especially indebted to the former Canadiens star Toe Blake, who became the team’s coach in 1955 and took Montreal to eight Stanley Cup championships.

Moore, who had not gotten along well with Blake’s predecessor, Dick Irvin, felt that Blake turned around his fortunes.

“When Toe became coach, I was elated,” Moore recalled in an interview for the Hockey Hall of Fame. “I was lucky to have a guy who believed in me. You’re only as good as how somebody can lift you up to the heights where he thinks you can play. Toe Blake had that in him.”",2018-02-11 00:48:40.366526,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"Dickie Moore, a Feisty Piece of a Canadiens Dynasty, Dies at 84",Richard Goldstein,,"['Deaths (Obituaries)', 'Montreal Canadiens', 'Hockey  Ice', 'Stanley Cup', 'Moore  Dickie (1931-2015)', 'Moore  Dickie']","Moore, who was a part of six Stanley Cup championship teams in Montreal, was a two-time N.H.L. scoring champion and played in six All-Star Games.",,,nytimes

The complaints over the Bruins’ being included in the tournament despite their 13 losses should be muted after their impressive win over the Blazers.

“The selection committee thought we were good enough to play in this tournament, and I think we proved it,” Parker said.

Jerod Haase, the U.A.B. coach, was struck by the cohesiveness of a U.C.L.A. team that often played selfishly early in the season. On Saturday, the U.C.L.A. player with the ball would draw a double-team, then skip the ball quickly to the open man.

“They have five guys that are all unique that all can, again, hurt you,” Haase said.

Robert Brown led U.A.B. with 25 points. The Blazers stayed competitive for 35 of the 40 minutes by making 12 of 26 shots from 3-point range.

“We knew that the rebounding part of it was going to be a huge factor in the game, and we got beat up on the boards,” Haase said. “There were some deep post-ups where we didn’t get around, and they were able to feed it directly to them.”

In the game’s first 15 minutes, U.A.B. showed that it would not consent to being pushed off the stage by one of college basketball’s most renowned programs. The Blazers made 6 of their first 9 attempts from beyond the 3-point arc — uncharacteristic for a team that ranked 238th in 3-point shooting among Division I teams (32.7 percent).

At least for a while, the Blazers’ 3-point shooting trumped their major issue in this matchup, which was trying to contend on the boards with U.C.L.A. The Bruins had a 21-8 rebounding advantage in the first half and did not let U.A.B. get to the offensive glass the way the Bruins did in their upset of third-seeded Iowa State in the round of 64.

The Blazers held an 18-13 lead early, but on the defensive end they had trouble containing Parker, who made 8 of 9 shots in the first half. Parker was averaging 10.9 points a game on a team with five starters averaging double figures in scoring.

U.C.L.A. shot 61 percent in the first half, then roared out in the second half to take a 54-40 lead.

Still, U.A.B. kept making shots and kept making a game of it. It trailed by 72-64, with 6 minutes 42 seconds to play, before U.C.L.A. finally pulled away.",2018-02-11 00:48:10.385971,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,U.C.L.A.

ALL FAVORED DISSOLUTION OF UNCURK. JAPAN COULD NOT AGREE TO UNILATERAL DISSOLUTION OF UNC AND NETHERLANDS FELT IT FEEL WITHIN SC'S COMPETENCE. OTHER SPEAKERS SUPPORTED ENDING UNC AND WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN TROOPS AND OPPOSED ADMISSION OF TWO KOREAS AT THIS TIME. SPEAKERS LISTED FOR NOV. 15 ARE USSR, ROK, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, CUBA, ZAIRE AND US. CHAIRMAN STATED THERE WERE NO SPEAKERS LISTED FOR AFTERNOON AND HE WOULD SCHEDULE VOTING ON DRAFT ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF DISARMAMENT AND ON ENDING NUCLEAR TESTING. IN REFERRING TO 26-POWER DRAFT RES (L. 645), CHINESE REP SAID IT WOULD CREATE PRETEXT FOR CONTINUED INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF KOREA BY OUTSIDE FORCES AND CHINA WAS RESOLUTELY AGAINST IT. NETHERLANDS REP DESCRIBED DRAFT AS CLEAR, SIMPLE, AND INCONTROVERSIAL. POLISH REP THOUGHT THAT RAISING QUESTION OF UN MEMBERSHIP COULD ONLY RAISE SUSPICIONS AS TO REAL MOTIVE BEHIND SUCH IDEA. ALGERIA--RAHAL DECLARED UN INVOLVEMENT IN KOREA HAD BEEN USED AS COVER-UP FOR US AGGRESSION -- UN HAD BEEN SIMPLY TOOL OF AGGRESSIVE US POLICY. IT WAS NECESSARY TO DISCUSS JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUATION OF UNCURK, UNC, AND US TROOPS IN SK UNDER UN FLAG. ELIMINATION OF UNC WOULD NOT ELIMINATE PARTY TO ARMISTICE AGREEMENT, SINCE IT WAS UN, NOT UNC, THAT WAS PARTY TO IT. UN, HE SAID, SHOULD PERSUADE SK TO ACCEPT PROPOSALS OF DPRK FOR RENUNCIATION OF USE OF FORCE, REDUCTION IN ARMAMENTS AND MILITARY FORCES, AND DRAWING UP OF PEACE TREATY. DPRK--LI JONG MOK, SPEAKING IN KOREAN, DECLARED ROOT CAUSE FOR FAILURE OF KOREA'S REUNIFICATION LAY IN OCCUPATION OF SK BY FOREIGN TROOPS AND CONTINUED FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS. NOT ONLY DID HE ASK THAT FOREIGN TROOPS UNDER NAME OF UN FORCE BE WITHDRAWN, BUT THAT JAPANESE ARMY BE PREVENTED UNCLASSIFIED PAGE 03 USUN N 04795 01 OF 03 150711Z FROM COMING INTO SK AFTER PULL-OUT OF US ARMY. HE ACCUSED US OF ""ACTIVELY INVOLVING JAPAN IN ITS MACHINATIONS TO FREEZE DIVISION OF KOREA,"" ADDING THAT REVIVED JAPANESE MILITARISM POSED SELF AS ANOTHER BIG STUMBLING BLOCK IN WAY OF PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. HE SAID ""THERE ARE NO FOREIGN TROOPS WHATSOEVER IN NORTHERN HALF OF DPRK,"" AND ASKED ON WHAT GROUNDS FOREIGN TROOPS COULD REMAIN IN SK. KOREAN QUESTION, HE SAID, SHOULD BE LEFT TO KOREAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES. HE ACCUSED US OF HAVING USED UN TO JUSTIFY ITS ILLEGAL ACTS, OF REDUCING SK TO COLONY, PROVOKING WAR, AND MAINTAINING STATE OF MILITARY CONFRONTATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH. HE REGRETTED SK AUTHORITIES FAILED ACCEPT DPRK'S PROPOSALS, AND MENTIONED INTENSIFIED SK SUPPRESSION, INCLUDING ABDUCTION OF KIM DOE JOONG FOR DEMANDING REUNIFICATION. DPRK WOULD IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDE PEACE AGREEMENT WITH SK AUTHORITIES IF THEY RESPONDED TO ITS SUGGESTIONS, AFTER ALL FOREIGN TROOPS WITHDRAWN, AND WOULD CONTINUE EFFORTS TOWARD REUNIFICATION. IT WAS UNTHINKABLE FOR KOREAN PEOPLE TO ENTER UN SEPARATELY, HE SAID, CALLING PROPOSAL FOR SIMULTANEOUS ENTRY ""ANOTHER CRAFTY TRICK."" IF THEY GAVE UP DIALOGUE WHICH HAD BEEN CONDUCTED SO FAR BY THEM AS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND MOVED TO UN TO MEET EACH OTHER ON STATE-VS-STATE BASIS IT WOULD NOT BRING THEM CLOSER BUT CAUSE ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THEM, LI STATED. CHINA--HUANG HUA URGED SUPPORT FOR 35-POWER (ALGERIAN) DRAFT RES, OF WHICH CHINA WAS COSPONSOR, AND RESOLUTELY OPPOSED OTHER RES. HE ASSERTED UNCURK HAD BEEN ILLEGAL FROM START AND CO-CALLED ""UN COMMAND"" WAS TOOLOF AGGRESSION. ARGUMENT DISSOLUTION OF UNC SHOULD GO BEFORE SC WAS BASED ON ULTERIOR MOTIVES DESIGNED TO ALLOW BIG POWER TO USE VETO AND PROLONG LIFE OF UNC INDEFINITELY. DIVISION OF KOREA WAS RESULT OF US AGGRESSION, KOREAN PEOPLE WANTED PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION, AND ""ABSURD PROPOSAL AIMED AT FORCING NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA TO JOIN UN...WAS TOTALLY UNTENABLE."" US TROOPS WERE STUMBLING BLOCK IN WAY OF PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. CHINA AND KOREA WERE NEIGHBORS, AND CHINA STOOD TOGETHER WITH KOREAN PEOPLE AND, IN PRESENT AND FUTURE, WOULD ""FIGHT TOGETHER WITH THEM."" NETHERLANDS--FACK SAID QUESTION OF KOREA SHOULD BE BROUGHT OUT OF COLD WAR ERA INTO AREA OF DETENTE. REUNIFICATION WAS UNCLASSIFIED PAGE 04 USUN N 04795 01 OF 03 150711Z QUESTION OF SELF-DETERMINATION, AND ONLY PEOPLE OF KOREA COULD SOLVE PROBLEM OF THEIR NATIONAL IDENTITY. IF 26-POWER RES (L. 645) ADOPTED, QUESTION WOULD NO LONGER BE ON AGENDA OF NEXT GA, AND IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY UP TO TWO KOREAS TO DECIDE WHEN TO APPLY FOR UN MEMBERSHIP. BULGARIA--GROZEV, WHO SAID TASK TODAY WAS TO MAKE SURE INTER- NATIONAL DETENTE APPLIED ALL OVER WORLD, FULLY SUPPORTED DPRK'S FIVE PROPOSITIONS. POLAND--JAROSZEK STATED UN'S PRESTIGE HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY EXISTENCE OF UNCURK AND PRESENCE OF ""SO-CALLED UN COMMAND,"" UN HAD DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE TO PROCESS OF DETENTE AND SHOULD DISCONTINUE AND WIND UP ITS DEPLORABLE INVOLVEMENT IN KOREAN QUESTION. ULTIMATE STEP WOULD BE TO HAVE ALL FOREIGN TROOPS STATIONED IN SK WITHDRAWN. JAPAN--SAITO THOUGHT IMPORTANT POINT WAS HELP PROMOTE DIALOGUE AND REFRAIN FROM ANY ACTION WHICH MIGHT OBSTRUCT IT. SINCE UNC WAS SOLE SIGNATORY REPRESENTING ONE OF TWO SIDES IN ARMISTICE AGREEMENT, UNILATERAL DISSOLUTION OF UNC WOULD THREATEN STABILITY IN KOREA AND CREATE CONDITIONS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH. UNLESS THERE WAS SUBSTITUTE FRAMEWORK FOR MAINTENANCE OF ARMISTICE STRUCTURE, JAPAN COULD NOT AGREE TO UNILATERAL DISSOLUTION OF UNC. IN HIS VIEW, THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER FOR DEMAND BY THIRD PARTY FOR WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGH TROOPS IN DISREGARD OF DESIRE AND WILL OF PEOPLE. SUDAN--ABDULLA DECLARED ""UN INTERVENTION IS US INTERVENTION""; UNCURK WAS BORN IN ILLEGALITY, AND ITS REPORTS TO GA HAD BEEN COMPILATION OF PROPAGANDA AND IRRELEVANT MATERIAL. HE CONTENDED THAT DIALOGUE BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF KOREA HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY SUDDEN SWITCH OVER IDEA OF CREATING TWO KOREAN STATES AND CALL TO ADMIT THEM TO UN. TWO KOREAS, HE SAID, COULD NOT BE ADMITTED TO UN AS UNIFIED STATE OR AS TWO STATES UNLESS TWO PARTS SETTLED THEIR DIFFERENCES. SAUDI ARABIA--BAROODY, GIVING HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF KOREAN QUESTION, REMARKED THERE WAS QUESTION AS TO WHO SOV REP MALIK HAD NOT EXERCISED VETO INSTEAD OF WALKING OUT OF SC; ONE UNCLASSIFIED PAGE 05 USUN N 04795 01 OF 03 150711Z DAY, IN A BOOK, HE WOULD GIVE THAT ANSWER. INTERRUPTING, MALIK SAID: ""SAY IT."" BAROODY TOLD HIM, ""NOT NOW."" BAROODY'S ARGUMENT WAS THAT STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF SUPER- POWERS BROUGHT ABOUT PRESENT SITUATION.

GMOs and Green Blob Hallucinations: The Twisted World of Mr Paterson

Speaking last week in Pretoria, former UK Environment Minister Owen Paterson described critics of GMOs as comprising part of a privileged class that increasingly fetishizes food and seeks to turn their personal preferences into policy proscriptions for the rest of us. He called them backward-looking and regressive. He claimed their policies would condemn billions to hunger, poverty and underdevelopment because of their insistence on mandating primitive, inefficient farming techniques.

He called them:

“… the ‘Green Blob’ – a reference to a 1950s Sci-Fi movie starring Steve McQueen in which a blob-like alien attacks Earth and swallows everything in its path: the environmental pressure groups, renewable energy companies and some public officials who keep each other well supplied with lavish funds, scare stories and green tape. This tangled triangle of unelected busybodies claims to have the interest of the planet and the countryside at heart, but it is increasingly clear that it is focusing on the wrong issues and doing real harm while profiting handsomely.”

He went on to state:

“There are many impediments standing between the vision of agricultural progress and Africa, of course, but none is more pernicious than the Blob. It is supported by massive funding provided by the EU itself, as well as numerous church and humanitarian groups, and the well-meaning but misguided generosity of the privileged classes in Europe and elsewhere. It has undue influence in the media, government and international institutions. Unfortunately, few question either its credentials or motives.” (see the full text of the speech here)

Paterson then proceeded to proclaim the virtues of GMOs and laid out a series of slurs, falsehoods and cherry-picked proclamations that anyone would be forgiven for thinking had come straight from the pen of a GMO agribusiness employee. But it wouldn’t have been the first time would it? In the case of this bit of poetry that Paterson likes so much, it came courtesy of Syngenta.

No, such practices are commonplace. Indeed, across the globe uncaged corporate parrots seem to be perched on the highest of ledges:

“We have had the National Academies of Science give a clean chit of biosafety to GM crops — doing that by using paragraphs lifted wholesale from the industry’s own literature! Likewise, Ministers in the PMO who know nothing about the risks of GMOs have similarly sung the virtues of Bt Brinjal and its safety to an erstwhile Minister of Health. They have used, literally, ‘cut & paste’ evidence from the biotech lobby’s ‘puff’ material. Are these officials then, ‘uncaged corporate parrots’?” Aruna Rodrigues, writing about the situation in India here in The Hindu.

Some points to consider for any rational thinking person.

1774,8560833.0,nytimes.com,reliable,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/theater/theater-myth-magic-and-us-mortals.html,"Second Stage is also the host for the slyly hip sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay, whose show, ''On the Stem,'' is a rakish vaudevillian tour of an old New York bursting with gamblers, con men and clowns. And there's none of the high-art preciousness that depleted so many New Vaudevillians; Mr. Jay is proud to stand with generations of hard-working scam artists at (his words) the crossroads of ''show business, crime and commerce.''

Finally, there is the triumphant return of the Martha Graham Dance Company, which has been divided by leadership and legal battles for years. Led by two great Graham dancers, Christine Dakin and Terese Capucilli, it renewed itself and returned to City Center on May 9, showing us just what the theater critic Eric Bentley meant when he called Graham (along with Charlie Chaplin) one of America's greatest playwrights. The actress Louise Brooks put it more insouciantly; she declared, ''I learned to act by watching Martha Graham dance, and I learned to dance by watching Charlie Chaplin act.''

'Metamorphoses'

I have seen ''Metamorphoses'' twice now, and both times I was charmed and stirred. It's the pleasure of motion, as gods, mortals and animals keep changing places, and the boundaries between what we feel and what we should feel keep getting erased, then redrawn; and the way everything is made visible too: how the actors go from language to gesture and from role to role, guided (and followed) by music, light and shadow.

Nevertheless, when someone whose judgment I respect a lot said he had left after the first act in a state of high irritation, I found myself asking, ''Was it the compulsive cuteness?'' Basically, it was. (Especially in the first act.)

Is it the script, which does like to play up quick-sketch laughs? Or the way the actors are directed (particularly as the stories begin) to be playful or aggressively winning in an almost Mickey and Judy way? Both, I think. This jokiness is part of our American performing style: youthful charm (no matter how old you are) and high-energy wisecracks as a way to deflect (or delay) strong feeling until you're ready for action. None of this ruined ''Metamorphoses'' for me. But in the end, what I liked best were the stories -- Cupid and Psyche, Orpheus and Eurydice, Cinyras and Myrrha -- that let emotion break through and flow without stopping.

'Ricky Jay: On the Stem'

Ricky Jay uses magic the way Chris Rock uses comedy or Ute Lemper uses cabaret songs. Magic's the medium, entertainment's the message. He doesn't go in for whimsy or give himself suavely mysterious airs. He's a burly guy in a dark blue suit and tie and red carnation, who stands casually onstage framed by old-fashioned red velvet curtains and gold braid (a complete fake, of course, painted on plywood). Then he starts spinning tales about the history of con games on the stage, on the street and ''on the stem'' (slang for Broadway).

His own sleight-of-hand cons include outlandish wins at poker games with gullible audience members, cards that hurtle through space like axes and decimate solid objects, and a flea circus whose acts include a micro-miniature version of the chariot race in ''Ben Hur.'' Wallets disappear from the pockets of watchful members of the audience; jewelry moves from one place to another the way souls were once said to pass from one body to another.

There is a mock instructional tone to it all. The first ''confidence man,'' we're told, appeared in 19th-century New York, a pleasant-looking fellow who engaged gullible strangers in amiable conversation, then asked, ''Have you confidence in me to trust me with your watch until tomorrow?'' Invariably they did -- whereupon he vanished, watch in hand, never to be seen again.

Mr. Jay likes to punctuate his own trickeration with a jaunty: ''Was that fair? I don't think so!'' He and his director, David Mamet, are a great match, with their fast, tough, shill-loving theatricality.

Orson Welles loved magic and used to say that women didn't because they didn't like to be fooled, while men did because they liked to be fooled -- and were. A friend of mine has proposed a link between biology and show business destiny. ''Magic is about things that appear and disappear,'' she says. ''And we know why men are interested in things that keep appearing and disappearing.''

I did expect to have fun at ''On the Stem,'' but I didn't expect to be so delighted. Nor did I expect such a variety of moods. There's a sad and tender story about an aging collector of Audubon's bird drawings. And though Mr. Jay invokes the names and glorious careers of master magicians, he also surrounds us with the ghosts of all the obscure, hard-working jugglers, carnival barkers and mountebanks who spent their lives playing for -- and with -- those huddled masses of happy suckers born every minute.

Martha Graham

Martha Graham loved to make oracular pronouncements, and since she was a genius, they have held up very well. She used to say that ''theater'' was a verb before it was a noun, and, in fact, the roots of the Greek word for ''theater'' are ''to see'' and ''a wonder.'' To wonder at isn't just to see, it is to observe with intensity, even awe. Graham let us see wonders, whether she chose Greek drama (Oedipus, Medea, Clytemnestra), or female artists and warriors (Emily Dickinson and Joan of Arc).

Her medium was dance, and, as with every great choreographer, it was a complete theatrical language. ''Seraphic Dialogue'' (1955) gives us four Joan of Arcs -- Joan as Maid, Joan as Warrior, Joan as Martyr and a Joan who is all of them and more (the superb Ms. Capucilli) as she confronts her saints, led by St. Michael, then goes, exultant, to her fate.

Watching these stories told through the bodies of the dancers, I thought of Lillian Gish and her claim that films had infinitely more force, beauty and universality when they did not depend on words. I'm never one to argue for our return to a supposedly golden past. But it has certainly been a long time since I saw performers give themselves so completely and with such mastery to their art.

''Night Journey'' (1947) is Graham's version of ''Oedipus.'' But here the central figure is the mother of Oedipus, Jocasta (danced by the stately Ms. Dakin). The Greek chorus consisted of six women, Daughters of the Night, who represent pure, concentrated grief and terror. Those molten torsos; those backs that arch and fall to the floor; jumps that make you feel the ground as much as the air; arms, hands, heads so exactly placed and held in space that every gesture is like a hieroglyph.

Graham created her own costumes. She also had clear, innovative ideas about set design, and in 1935 she began a collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi that lasted more than 30 years. In ''Seraphic Dialogue,'' the stage is dominated by a gleaming brass edifice -- a cathedral of thin gold lines and circles that the dancers moved in and out of.

Since Sept. 11, American artists (especially those who work in New York) have been talking obsessively about how to make art that matters. The last segment of the program was ''Steps in the Street,'' part of a seldom seen anti-fascist work that Graham created in 1936. It is one of her early abstract pieces. Women in black move across the stage in silence at first. Sometimes their steps are exaggerated, their jumps staccato and repeated; sometimes they move together, as if pushed or driven along. Gradually, one woman (Miki Orihara) begins to separate herself from the others, or to be pulled away from them. Their rhythms and steps grow more insistent and unified. By the end, they are nearly (but not quite) marching. And she is alone, left to move by herself, with quiet, determined rhythm, in the opposite direction. Why do some people still ask if women can embody the universal as powerfully as men? Franco's Spain was there, right in front of us. The wonder is that at the time so few people saw it with such awful and awesome clarity.",2018-02-11 00:36:46.776321,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346838,2018-02-11 00:14:20.346871,"Theater; Myth, Magic And Us Mortals",Margo Jefferson,,"['GRAHAM  MARTHA  DANCE CO', 'ZIMMERMAN  MARY', 'JAY  RICKY', 'MAGIC AND MAGICIANS', 'DANCING', 'THEATER', 'METAMORPHOSES (PLAY)']","Margo Jefferson column on playwrights who are constructing new works, most of them being shown Off Broadway and in regional theaters, from Greek history, myth and tradition; reviews Mary Zimmerman's Metamorphoses, Ricky Jay's magic show and performances by Martha Graham Dance Company; photos (M)",,,nytimes

After eight years, researchers finally developed a robotic bird, called the “Robo Raven” whose wings can flap independently of each other.

Developed by University of Maryland Professors S.K. Gupta and Hugh Bruck and their students, it is interesting to note that the technology allows the robotic bird to achieve “any desired motion and to perform aerobatic maneuvers,” according to Fox 5.

Professor Gupta says that the possibilities for using the robo bird are endless. The final design of the bird even allows for a tiny video camera to be inserted into it.

The Robo Raven can be launched from the ground and can even fly in winds up to 10 MPH, according to Fox 5. It is possible that some day, the robotic birds could even be used for “reconnaissance and surveillance,” Fox 5 reports.

The Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeals argued that Sheriff Jerry Larpenter’s investigation into the blog ExposeDAT had flawed rationale: the alleged defamation was not actually a crime as applied to a public official.

The unanimous ruling from the three-judge panel comes after police officer Wayne Anderson and his wife Jennifer Anderson were denied assistance in local and federal court.

“I love it when justice is tangible,” Jerri Smitko, one of the Andersons’ laywers, told The Intercept.

“With that piece of paper it says that what they did was unconstitutional — that’s a great feeling because you’re holding it in your hand and it’s vindication for people that they intended to oppress,” she added.

The raid was sparked by the sheriff’s investigation into who was behind the anonymous blog that accused local officials, including him, of corruption and fraud. Through a blog and a Facebook page called “John Turner,”ExposeDAT used public records to show conflicts of interest.

Hispanic teen birth rates in Connecticut are 8.5 times higher than whites’ and almost double that of African Americans for girls ages 15 to 19. Of the 2,626 teen births in 2009, almost half (1,277) were to Hispanics, according to data from the state Department of Public Health.

In Connecticut, 84 percent of births to teen mothers (ages 15 to 19) in 2009 were to low-income mothers enrolled in the publicly subsidized HUSKY or Medicaid health plans. The number of births to teens in these programs remains steady, immune to the declines statewide and nationally.

Advocates hope $$6.4 million in federal funds targeting at-risk Hispanic and African-American teens in the state’s poorest cities will make a difference by reaching youth in ways that resonate with their culture and language.

But many experts say little will change until the state has the financial resources and political will to address the underlying issues—poverty, domestic violence, education achievement gaps, unemployment—that impact Hispanic youth.

Complicating matters are language and cultural factors that research shows put Hispanics at greater risk of becoming parents, experts say. These run the gamut from strictly defined gender roles and machismo, to religious beliefs that ban contraception and abortion.

At 13 percent of the state’s population, the Hispanic community is growing at a dramatic rate—by almost 50 percent during the past decade—and experiencing increasing social and health inequities.

Almost a third of Hispanic children ages 17 and younger live in poverty. Almost 22 percent of all Hispanics have no health insurance. The state’s Hispanics had the third highest unemployment rate in the nation in 2010, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Hispanics had a four-year high school graduation rate of 64 percent in 2010, according to state Department of Education data.

As a public health issue, teen childbearing cost state taxpayers at least $$137 million in 2008 for public health care, child welfare, incarceration and lost tax revenue due to decreased earnings and spending, reports the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.

In New London, the Board of Education voted this month to allow the health clinic at New London High School to distribute birth control pills and condoms to students who have parental consent. The center already provides pregnancy tests and treats sexually transmitted diseases, but never handed out contraception before.

“It was not an easy decision to make but the only one that was responsible when you look at the alarming rate of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy among our youth,” said Liz Garcia Gonzalez, vice president of the New London Board of Education and executive director of Centro de la Comunidad of New London.
